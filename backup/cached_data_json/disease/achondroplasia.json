The mutant FGFR3 found in ACH is continuously phosphorylated and activates downstream signals, resulting in abnormal proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth plate and cranial base synchondrosis. A patient registry has been developed and has contributed to revealing the natural history of ACH patients. Concerning the short stature, the adult height of ACH patients ranges between 126.7-135.2 cm for men and 119.9-125.5 cm for women in many countries. Along with severe short stature, foramen magnum stenosis and spinal canal stenosis are major complications: the former leads to sleep apnea, breathing disorders, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, and sudden death, and the latter causes pain in the extremities, numbness, muscle weakness, movement disorders, intermittent claudication, and bladder-rectal disorders. Growth hormone treatment is available for ACH only in Japan. However, the effect of the treatment on adult height is not satisfactory.

Inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed molecular HCH diagnosis (by age 3\u2009years) and presenting with short long-bones or large head size on antenatal ultrasound scan. We then conducted a systematic literature review using PUBMED and MEDLINE, analyzing patients with HCH and related antenatal findings. Antenatally suspected (with subsequent molecular confirmation) HCH has been reported 15 times in the literature (2004-2019). Key markers (consistent in both groups) included reduced; femur length, humeral length and increased; biparietal diameter and head circumference. HCH is increasingly detected both antenatally and in infancy, contrary to previous descriptions. This is likely due to greater HCH awareness, improved imaging, and easier molecular testing.
