The pathophysiology involves an immune response mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) that triggers mast cells to release inflammatory mediators, leading to bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. Clinically, asthma manifests with variable airflow obstruction that can be exacerbated by allergens, irritants, and respiratory infections. There is a significant unmet need for more personalized treatment options, as current therapies often fail to control symptoms in a subset of patients, particularly those with severe or refractory asthma.", "synonyms": [{"relation": "hasExactSynonym", "terms": ["bronchial hyperreactivity"]}, {"relation": "hasNarrowSynonym", "terms": ["chronic obstructive asthma with acute exacerbation",

This superiority of biologic treatment, which cannot be solely explained by insufficient doses or limited durations of glucocorticoid therapies, needs to be further explored. For this field of research, we propose a novel classification of the potential effects of biologics on airway remodeling into three temporal effects: early effects (days to weeks, primarily modulating inflammatory processes), late effects (months to years, predominantly affecting structural changes), and potential preventive effects (outcomes of early treatment with biologics).

A plethora of inflammatory, autoimmune, hematological, thrombotic, and vascular diseases can lead to osteonecrosis. Corticosteroids are intimately linked to the development of osteonecrosis. The frequent use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with asthma, eczema, nasal polyposis, sinusitis, urticaria and angioedema, or anaphylaxis makes this disease of great relevance to the practicing allergist and pulmonologist. Untreated, bone necrosis leads to frustrated bone remodeling and angiogenesis, leading to subchondral fractures and collapse of the articular heads of the bones, and culminating in debilitating osteoarthritis, often requiring arthroplasty. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying osteonecrosis and on the role of glucocorticoids. The gold standard test in patients suspected of having the disease is magnetic resonance imaging scanning, with plain radiographs having a lower sensitivity and specificity. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential. The allergist should avoid the frequent use of glucocorticoids and consider early introduction of steroid-sparing alternatives for asthma or sinusitis.

The efficacy of mepolizumab, a biological treatment targeting interleukin 5, has been demonstrated in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, particularly in terms of reducing exacerbations.

The recently approved product contains an ICS-albuterol combination. The 2024 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend as-needed ICS-formoterol as the preferred asthma reliever therapy; however, a GINA alternative recommendation is the use of ICS whenever an as-needed (SABA) is used. There is no difference in as-needed asthma treatment recommended by the GINA guidelines in older adults, and there has been minimal study in older adults. Because of limited guidance on the use of the ICS-SABA reliever inhaler in older adults, the purpose of this review is to evaluate the DENALI and MANDALA studies and the potential role of ICS-SABA in older adults. The mean ages in both studies were 50 years. The MANDALA primary outcome result was a statistically significant lower risk of severe exacerbations in the ICS-SABA reliever group compared with the as-needed albuterol (ALB) group at 24 weeks. In the MANDALA older adults subgroup analysis, there was not a statistically significant difference in the ICS-SABA reliever group compared with the as-needed ALB-alone group but the results favored ICS-SABA.

Our review highlights that type 2 inflammation may be the strongest predictor of biologic response. Key comorbidities (eg, obesity and mood disorders) and behavioral factors (eg, poor adherence, improper inhalation technique, and smoking) were identified as dominant traits limiting remission.

New experimental evidence on mice suggests that not only the smooth muscle is required to sustain life postnatally, but its stiffening effect on the lung tissue also protects against excessive airway narrowing and, most importantly, against small airway narrowing heterogeneity and closure. These results suggest that the smooth muscle plays an vital role in the lung periphery, essentially safeguarding alveolar ventilation by preventing small airway closure. These results also shed light on perplexing clinical observations, such as the long-standing doubts about the safety of bronchodilators. Since there seems to be an optimal level of smooth muscle contraction, at least in small airways, the therapeutic goal of maximizing the relaxation of the smooth muscle in asthma needs to be revisited.

To achieve precise personalized therapy, it has become necessary to focus on the individual phenotypes and underlying causal molecular mechanisms (endotypes) and to identify key therapeutic targets, which are called treatable traits. This review discusses the evidence for the importance of identifying treatable traits and therapeutic strategies based on the broader perspective of chronic obstructive airway disease rather than on individual diseases such as asthma or COPD.", "Year": "2025", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38432980/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy"]}, {"PMID": "38418669", "Title": "Natural Products for the Management of Asthma and COPD.", "Abstract": "Chronic airway inflammatory diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their associated exacerbations cause significant socioeconomic burden. There are still major obstacles to effective therapy for controlling severe asthma and COPD progression. Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the two diseases at the cellular and molecular levels are essential for the development of novel therapies. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to identify natural products as potential drug leads for treatment of human diseases and to investigate their efficacy, safety, and underlying mechanisms of action. Many major active components from various natural products have been extracted, isolated, and evaluated for their pharmacological efficacy and safety. For the treatment of asthma and COPD, many promising natural products have been discovered and extensively investigated. In this chapter, we will review a range of natural compounds from different chemical classes, including terpenes, polyphenols, alkaloids, fatty acids, polyketides, and vitamin E, that have been demonstrated effective against asthma and/or COPD and their exacerbations in preclinical models and clinical trials. We will also elaborate in detail their underlying mechanisms of action unraveled by these studies and discuss new opportunities and potential challenges for these natural products in managing asthma and COPD.", "Year": "2025", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38418669/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"]}, {"PMID": "39751959", "Title": "Group 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells: A Potential Therapeutic Target for Steroid Resistant Asthma.", "Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease that affects millions globally. Although glucocorticoids are a mainstay of asthma treatment, a subset of patients show resistance to these therapies, resulting in poor disease control and increased morbidity. The complex mechanisms underlying steroid-resistant asthma (SRA) involve Th1 and Th17 lymphocyte activity, neutrophil recruitment, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Recent studies provided evidence that innate lymphoid cells type 3 (ILC3s) might be potential therapeutic targets for non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA) and SRA. Like Th17 cells, ILC3s play crucial roles in immune responses, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis, contributing to disease severity and corticosteroid resistance in NEA. Biologics targeting ILC3-related pathways have shown promise in managing Th2-low asthma, suggesting new avenues for SRA treatment. This review aims to explore the risk factors for SRA, discuss the challenges and mechanisms underlying SRA, consolidate current findings on innate lymphoid cells, and elucidate their role in respiratory conditions. We present the latest findings on the involvement of ILC3s in human diseases and explore their potential mechanisms in SRA development. Furthermore, we review emerging therapeutic biologics targeting ILC3-related pathways in managing NEA and SRA.

Most often, upper respiratory tract infections are self-limiting. Still, those that involve the lower respiratory tract are usually associated with asthma exacerbations, leading to worsening or even the initiation of the disease. A key role in regulating the immune response and inflammation during viral infections and their impact on the progression of asthma has been demonstrated for miRNA molecules (microRNA). Their interaction with mRNA (messenger RNA) regulates gene expression in innate and acquired immune responses, making them valuable biomarkers for diagnostics, monitoring, and predicting asthma exacerbations. The following paper presents changes in the expression of miRNAs during the five most common viral infections causing asthma worsening, with particular emphasis on the pediatric population. In addition, we describe the molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs influence the pathogenesis of viral infection, immune responses, and asthma exacerbations.

Despite such limitations, the aggregate evidence from studies conducted in different locations and populations suggests that ETV affects asthma and asthma outcomes, and that this is explained by direct physiologic effects of violence-related distress and indirect effects (e.g., through risky health behaviors or co-morbidities). Thus, large prospective studies with careful assessment of specific types of ETV, key covariates and comorbidities (including mental illness), and asthma are needed to advance this field.

Under type 2 inflammatory conditions, human airway epithelial cells activate 15-lipoxygenase-1 in complex with phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-1, leading to the generation of electrophilic hydroperoxyl-phospholipids. When the accumulation of reactive lipid peroxidation surpasses a specific glutathione-dependent activity, these electrophilic compounds are not neutralized, leading to programmed cell death, ferroptosis. Reduced glutathione levels, caused by type 2 inflammation, may impair its ability to neutralize reactive lipid peroxidation. The accumulation of lipid peroxidation with intracellular redox imbalance may contribute to asthma exacerbations in individuals with type 2 inflammation. Inhibiting the ferroptotic pathway holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate asthma exacerbations.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39182396/", "Qualifers": ["metabolism", "etiology"]}, {"PMID": "39181277", "Title": "Choosing the right biologic treatment for individual patients with severe asthma - Lessons learnt from Picasso.", "Abstract": "Severe asthma represents a true challenge for clinicians from two basic perspectives, i.e.: a rational assessment of the underlying endo/phenotype and the subsequent selection of the best fitted (personalized) and effective treatment.

However, the absence of deeper assessment of individual patients revealed its handicap to its fullest extent during the first years of the new millennium upon the launch of biological therapeutics for patients with the most severe forms of asthma. The introduction of differentially targeted biologics into clinical practice became a challenge in terms of understanding and recognizing the etiopathogenetic heterogeneity of the asthmatic inflammation, pheno/endotyping, and, consequently, to choose the right biologic for the right patient. The answers to the following three questions should lead to correct identification of the dominant pheno/endotype: Is it really (severe) asthma? Is it eosinophilic asthma? If eosinophilic, is it (predominantly) allergen-driven? The identification of the best achievable and relevant alliance between endotypes and phenotypes (\"euphenotypes\") should be based not only on the assessment of the actual clinical characteristics and laboratory biomarkers, but more importantly, on the evaluation of their development and changes over time.

Obesity is a significant risk factor and disease modifier for asthma, complicating treatment. Epidemiological evidence highlights that obese asthma correlates with poorer disease control, increased severity and persistence, compromised lung function and reduced quality of life. Various mechanisms contribute to the physiological and clinical complexities observed in individuals with obesity and asthma. These encompass different immune responses, including Type IVb, where T helper 2 cells are pivotal and driven by cytokines like interleukins 4, 5, 9 and 13, and Type IVc, characterised by T helper 17 cells and Type 3 innate lymphoid cells producing interleukin 17, which recruits neutrophils. Additionally, Type V involves immune response dysregulation with significant activation of T helper 1, 2 and 17 responses. Finally, Type VI is recognised as metabolic-induced immune dysregulation associated with obesity. Body mass index (BMI) stands out as a biomarker of a treatable trait in asthma, readily identifiable and targetable, with significant implications for disease management. There exists a notable gap in treatment options for individuals with obese asthma, where asthma management guidelines lack specificity. For example, there is currently no evidence supporting the use of incretin mimetics to improve asthma outcomes in asthmatic individuals without Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

It is hypothesized that maternal atopic disease during pregnancy can lead to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in fetal circulation via placental transfer or increased production. These cytokines can then pass through the immature blood-brain barrier, causing aberrant neurodevelopment via mechanisms including premature microglial activation. The objective of this study is to systematically review observational studies that investigate whether a maternal history of atopic disease (asthma, allergy, or eczema/atopic dermatitis) is associated with a diagnosis of ASD in offspring. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases for relevant articles up to November 2021; this was later updated in January 2022. Observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Data were synthesized and qualitatively analyzed according to the specific atopic condition. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Nine articles were identified, with all including asthma as an exposure, alongside four each for allergy and eczema.

This review provides an overview of pulmonary lymphatic biology and delves into the involvement of lymphatics in four major lung diseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), asthma, and lung transplant rejection. We examine how lymphatic abnormalities manifest in each of these conditions and investigate the mechanisms through which lymphatic remodeling and dysfunction contribute to disease progression.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent diseases in Italy, posing significant public health challenges. Tobacco smoking, a primary risk factor for COPD and a common asthma trigger, remains a critical preventable public health issue. While universally acknowledged that quitting smoking drastically reduces the risk of smoking-related health issues, a significant portion of smokers and patients find quitting challenging or undesirable, hence a need for new ways to deal with it. A worth considering alternative might be the switch to electronic cigarettes (e-cig), and heat-not-burn/heated tobacco products (HnB/HTP). Emerging evidence suggests potential benefits in asthma and COPD management when transitioning from traditional smoking to e-cigs or HnB devices. However, the effectiveness of these products in facilitating smoking cessation is still debated, alongside concerns about their role in promoting smoking initiation among non-smokers. Internists are among the physicians who most frequently assist patients with smoking-related diseases, and in this perspective they cannot avoid paying attention to the progressive diffusion of smoking products alternative to the traditional cigarette, and to the controversies with respect to their use.

Recent data regarding primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) may help us to understand the association. Here, I will review what is known about the relationship between ciliary function and asthma. PCD is caused by pathologic variants in over 50 different genes that affect the structure and function of motile cilia. At the cellular level, a characteristic feature shared by most PCD patients is that antigens and other particles are not cleared from the epithelial surface. Poor antigen clearance results in pro-oxidant pathway activation and airway epithelial damage and may predispose PCD patients to DUOX1- and IL33-mediated asthma. Secondary ciliary dysfunction, such as that caused by viruses or by smoking, can also contribute to asthma development. Moreover, variants in genes that affect the function of cilia can be associated with poor lung function, even in the absence of PCD, and with increased asthma severity. The role of antigen stasis on the surface of dysfunctional airway cilia in the pathophysiology of asthma is a novel area for research, because specific airway clearance techniques and other therapeutic interventions, such as antioxidants, could be of value in preventing the development of asthma.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39337527/", "Qualifers": ["metabolism", "etiology", "pathology"]}, {"PMID": "38981012", "Title": "Asthma Inception: Epidemiologic Risk Factors and Natural History Across the Life Course.", "Abstract": "Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing.

A critical component in the pathogenesis of each condition is the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), a multifunctional cytokine that exerts varying influences across these diseases. In asthma, TGF-\u03b2 is significantly involved in airway remodeling, a key aspect marked by subepithelial fibrosis, hypertrophy of the smooth muscle, enhanced mucus production, and suppression of emphysema development. The cytokine facilitates collagen deposition and the proliferation of fibroblasts, which are crucial in the structural modifications within the airways. In contrast, the role of TGF-\u03b2 in COPD is more ambiguous. It initially acts as a protective agent, fostering tissue repair and curbing inflammation. However, prolonged exposure to environmental factors such as cigarette smoke causes TGF-\u03b2 signaling malfunction. Such dysregulation leads to abnormal tissue remodeling, marked by excessive collagen deposition, enlargement of airspaces, and, thus, accelerated development of emphysema. Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 facilitates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process contributing to the phenotypic alterations observed in COPD. A thorough comprehension of the multifaceted role of TGF-\u03b2 in asthma and COPD is imperative for elaborating precise therapeutic interventions. We review several promising approaches that alter TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

The predominant mucins in human mucus, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are secreted by specialized cells within the airway epithelium both in normal conditions and in response to various stimuli. Their relative proportions are correlated with specific inflammatory responses and disease mechanisms. The dysregulation of mucin expression is implicated in numerous respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, where the pathogenic role of mucus has been extensively described yet often overlooked. In airway diseases, excessive mucus production or impaired mucus clearance leads to mucus plugging, with secondary airway occlusion that contribute to airflow obstruction, asthma severity and poor control. Eosinophils and Charcot Leyden crystals in sputum contribute to the mucus burden and tenacity. Mucin may also contribute to eosinophil survival. Other mechanisms, including eosinophil-independent IL-13 release, mast-cell activation and non-type-2 (T2) cytokines, are also likely to participate in mucus pathobiology. An accurate assessment of mucus and its clinical and functional consequences require a thorough approach that includes evaluation of cellular predominance in sputum, airway cytokines and other inflammatory markers, mucus characteristics and composition and structural and functional impact measured by advanced lung imaging.

Current evidence suggests that high prenatal and early childhood vitamin D could be protective against respiratory infections and asthma in some studies where several mechanisms are proposed. However, other studies have reported no effects on these outcomes. Therefore, future large intervention studies on this topic are warranted. Mechanistic studies have shown that vitamin D holds antimicrobial properties by inducing production of several peptides through altered gene expression. Others have shown a complex interplay between asthma risk genotypes, the sphingolipid pathway, and prenatal vitamin D in early childhood asthma. Vitamin D has also been suggested to change both airway immune and microbiota profiles, which are directly related to asthma risk.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have found that lipid metabolism influences both the development and symptomatology of asthma. Lipid metabolism plays an important role both in the occurrence of exacerbations and in the reduction of lung inflammation. Our study aimed to identify any type of association between patients diagnosed with asthma and their serum lipids, including HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides in adults. (2) Methods: To find articles for our review, we searched two platforms: PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 309 articles from two platforms were analyzed. Finally, 12 papers were selected from the initial pool of identified articles. (3) Results: The positive correlation between triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), and asthma has been demonstrated in several studies. Moreover, it appears that there is an association between biomarkers of type 2 inflammation and HDL and serum triglycerides in people with atopic status. Regarding the nutrition of asthmatic patients, the greatest impact on the development of the disease seems to be the consumption of fruit and vegetables. Several studies show that a predominantly vegan diet is associated with better control of the disease and a decrease in the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (4) Conclusions: Studies show a positive correlation between total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol levels and asthma and a negative correlation between HDL-cholesterol and asthma. Increased cholesterol values would lead to the stimulation of pro-inflammatory processes and the secretion of cytokines involved in these processes. The most successful diets for asthma patients seem to be those in which the consumption of fruit, vegetables, and high-fiber foods is increased because all of these food groups are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Systematic Review", "Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38999820/", "Qualifers": ["blood"]}, {"PMID": "38937520", "Title": "Can we measure whether asthma guidelines lead to improved care?", "Abstract": "The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollege Guidelines Network (SIGN), as well as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), have previously produced separate asthma guidance differing in some key aspects in diagnosis and management leading to confusion, potentially hampering guideline dissemination and uptake.

Already at birth, these newborns have demonstrated accelerated maturation and upregulation of host defense immune functions suggesting a prenatal transplacental training of the innate immune system through maternal microbial exposure. This mechanism could possibly be utilized to help prevent both respiratory infections and asthma in young children.

Effective disease-modifying approaches, therefore, need to target the pathways driving the symptoms. We have good evidence to show that targeting airway eosinophilia alone in early-life preschool wheezing and using inhaled corticosteroids is not disease-modifying. Although airway remodelling develops early in preschool wheezing, the challenge is identifying suitable treatments for structural airway changes. There is increasing evidence for the role of lower airway bacterial infection contributing to wheeze episodes, but clinical trials investigating the impact of targeted antibiotic treatment on disease modification are needed. There is also increasing data supporting an association between lower airway neutrophilia and wheezing in a subgroup of preschool children, but direct causation and the role of neutrophil function remain unknown. Finally, there is encouraging preliminary data for the role of inactivated mixed bacterial lysates in children with non-allergic, infection-associated wheeze episodes, but the impact on longer-term outcomes and their mechanism of action is unknown.

Definitive studies have provided evidence-based data to demonstrate its effectiveness in allergic rhinitis and asthma due to the inhalation of proteinaceous allergic substances from specific seasonal pollens, dust mites, animal allergens, and certain mold spores. Over the ensuing decades, laboratory investigations have provided objective evidence to demonstrate immunologic changes, including production of protective IgG antibody, suppression of IgE antibody, upregulation of regulatory T cells, and induction of a state of immune tolerance to the offending allergen(s). Tangential to this work were carefully designed clinical studies that defined allergen dose and duration of treatment, established the importance of preparing extracts with standardized allergens (or well-defined extracts) based on major protein moieties, and used allergen provocation models to demonstrate efficacy superior to placebo. In the United States, the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy extracts for AIT was grandfathered in by the Food and Drug Administration based on expert literature review. In contrast, sublingual tablet immunotherapy underwent formal clinical development programs (phase I-III clinical trials) that provided the necessary clinical evidence for safety and efficacy that led to regulatory agency approvals for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in properly characterized patients with allergy.

Biologic therapies, such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, and tezepelumab, have demonstrated efficacy in targeting specific pathways associated with severe asthma in elderly individuals. However, a significant research gap exists in the application of these therapies in elderly asthma patients. Despite the considerable size of the elderly asthma population and the social and economic burden that this specific demographic imposes on society, the available body of research catering to this group is limited. Notably, no RCTs have been expressly designed for the elderly across all asthma biologic therapies. Moreover, most RCTs have set upper age cutoffs, commonly 75 years old, and exclusion criteria for common comorbidities in the elderly, thus marginalizing this group from pivotal research. This underscores the crucial need for intentional inclusion of elderly participants in separately designed clinical trials and more researches, aiming to augment the generalizability of findings and enhance therapeutic outcomes. Given the distinct physiological changes associated with aging, there may be a concern regarding the efficacy and safety of biologic therapies in the elderly compared to non-elderly adults, posing a barrier to their use in this population.

This review explores how abnormal triggering of the autonomic diving reflex might be important in explaining research findings and the real-world experience of asthma. It hypothesises that the way in which stress during pregnancy is associated with childhood asthma could be through effects on the developing nervous system. This results in increased parasympathetic responsiveness and specifically, excessive triggering of the diving reflex in response to wetting and cooling of the face and nose as occurs with upper airway infections and allergic rhinitis. In aquatic mammals the reflex importantly includes the contraction of airway smooth muscle to minimise lung volume and prevent nitrogen narcosis from diving at depth. Misfiring of this reflex in humans could result in the pathological airway narrowing that occurs in asthma. The diving reflex, and possibly also smooth muscle, is a vestigial remnant of our aquatic past. The hypothesis further suggests that classically conditioned reflex responses to neutral cues and contexts that were present at the same time as the stimuli that initially caused symptoms, become of themselves ongoing triggers of recurrent wheeze. Symptoms occurring in this way, irrespective of the presence of allergens and ongoing airway sensitisation, explain why allergen avoidance is poorly effective in alleviating wheeze and why asthma is made worse by stress.

Machine learning is increasingly applied in healthcare to assist health practitioners in decision-making. In asthma management, machine learning excels in performing well-defined tasks, such as diagnosis, prediction, medication, and management. However, there remain uncertainties about how machine learning can be applied to predict asthma exacerbation. This study aimed to systematically review recent applications of machine learning techniques in predicting the risk of asthma attacks to assist asthma control and management. A total of 860 studies were initially identified from five databases. After the screening and full-text review, 20 studies were selected for inclusion in this review. The review considered recent studies published from January 2010 to February 2023. The 20 studies used machine learning techniques to support future asthma risk prediction by using various data sources such as clinical, medical, biological, and socio-demographic data sources, as well as environmental and meteorological data. While some studies considered prediction as a category, other studies predicted the probability of exacerbation. Only a group of studies applied prediction windows. The paper proposes a conceptual model to summarise how machine learning and available data sources can be leveraged to produce effective models for the early detection of asthma attacks.

Although subjective asthma monitoring tools are available, the results vary as they rely on patients' self-perception. Emerging evidence suggests several objective tools could have the potential for monitoring purposes. However, there is no consensus to standardise the use of objective monitoring tools.

Eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of airway disease mainly by releasing eosinophil-specific granules, lipid mediators, superoxide anions, and their DNA. Type-2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 also play roles in the development of bronchial asthma. Among these cytokines, IL-4 is involved in T-cell differentiation, B-cell activation, B-cell differentiation into plasma cells, and the production of immunoglobulin E. Although IL-13 has similar effects to IL-4, IL-13 mainly affects structural cells, such as epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. IL-13 induces the differentiation of goblet cells that produce mucus and induces the airway remodeling, including smooth muscle hypertrophy. IL-4 and IL-13 do not directly activate the effector functions of eosinophils; however, they can induce eosinophilic airway inflammation by upregulating the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (for adhesion) and CC chemokine receptor 3 ligands (for migration). Dupilumab, a human anti-IL-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, decreases asthma exacerbations and mucus plugs and increases lung function in moderate to severe asthma.

NPSR facilitates reward, reinforcement, and addiction-related behaviors. Genetic variation and single nucleotide polymorphism in NPSR are associated with depression, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. NPS interacts with several neurotransmitters including glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and gamma-aminobutyric acid.

The concept of remission in severe asthma as a new treatment goal has recently gained attention due to the growing use of monoclonal antibody therapies, which target specific pathologic pathways of inflammation. This review evaluates the current definitions of asthma remission and unveils some of the barriers for achieving this state in the severe asthma population. Although there is no unified definition, the concept of clinical remission in asthma should be based on a sustained period of symptom control, elimination of oral corticosteroid exposure and exacerbations, and stabilization of pulmonary function. The conjugation of these criteria seems a realistic treatment target in a minority of asthmatic patients. Some unmet needs in severe asthma may affect the achievement of clinical remission. Late intervention with targeted therapies in the severe asthma population may increase the risk of corticosteroid exposure and the development of irreversible structural airway changes. Moreover, airway infection is an important component in persistent exacerbations in patients on biologic therapies. Phenotyping exacerbations may be useful to guide therapy decisions and to avoid the liberal use of oral corticosteroids. Another challenge associated with the aim of clinical remission in severe asthma is the multifaceted interaction between the disease and its associated comorbidities. Behavioural factors should be evaluated in case of persistent symptoms despite optimised treatment, and assessing biomarkers and targeting treatable traits may allow for a more objective way of reaching remission. The concept of clinical remission will benefit from an international consensus to establish unifying criteria for its assessment, and it should be addressed in the future management guidelines.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38658975/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy", "diagnosis", "physiopathology", "epidemiology"]}, {"PMID": "38146826", "Title": "Updates in the treatment of asthma in pediatrics: A review for pharmacists.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarize the management of asthma in children and to highlight different guideline-based approaches.

Yet, the exact mechanisms underlying the bronchiolitis-asthma link remain uncertain. Birth cohort studies have reported this association at the population level, including only small groups of patients with a history of bronchiolitis, and have attempted to identify the underlying biological mechanisms. Although this evidence has provided valuable insights, there are still unanswered questions regarding severe bronchiolitis-asthma pathogenesis. Recently, a few bronchiolitis cohort studies have attempted to answer these questions by applying unbiased analytical approaches to biological data. These cohort studies have identified novel bronchiolitis subtypes (i.e., endotypes) at high risk for asthma development, representing essential and enlightening evidence. For example, one distinct severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis endotype is characterized by the presence of Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, higher levels of type I/II IFN expression, and changes in carbohydrate metabolism in nasal airway samples, and is associated with a high risk for childhood asthma development.

Environmental microbial and lifestyle factors that disrupt this process can dysregulate immune homeostasis, predisposing infants to atopic disease and childhood asthma. In health, the low-biomass lung microbiome, together with inhaled environmental microbial constituents, establishes the immunological set point that is necessary to maintain pulmonary immune defense. However, in disease perturbations to immunological and physiological processes allow the upper respiratory tract to act as a reservoir of pathogenic bacteria, which can colonize the diseased lung and cause severe inflammation. Studying these host-microbe interactions in respiratory diseases holds great promise to stratify patients for suitable treatment regimens and biomarker discovery to predict disease progression.

Its intricate biochemistry renders it a crucial regulator of cardiovascular and pulmonary functions, immunity, and neurotransmission. Perturbations in NO production, whether excessive or insufficient, contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, encompassing cardiovascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, diabetes, and cancer. Recent investigations have unveiled the potential of NO donors to impede SARS-CoV- 2 replication, while inhaled NO demonstrates promise as a therapeutic avenue for improving oxygenation in COVID-19-related hypoxic pulmonary conditions.

Airway epithelial cells clear airways from inhaled irritants and orchestrate the inflammatory response of airways to these irritants by secreting various lipid mediators, growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines.

The specific combination of different basic pathogeneses in each patient determines the phenotype of the patient, and it varies widely from patient to patient.

Microbial colonization of the gut begins at birth, and factors such as delivery mode, breastfeeding, diet, antibiotic use, and exposure to environmental bacteria influence the development of the infant microbiome.

The most important physiological mechanism in the context of imaging is the so-called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV, also known as \"Euler-Liljestrand-Reflex\"), which couples lung perfusion to lung ventilation. In obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and asthma, HPV downregulates pulmonary perfusion in order to redistribute blood flow to functional lung areas in order to conserve optimal oxygenation. Imaging of lung perfusion can be seen as a reflection of lung ventilation in obstructive airway diseases. Other conditions that primarily affect lung perfusion are pulmonary vascular diseases, pulmonary hypertension, or (chronic) pulmonary embolism, which also lead to inhomogeneity in pulmonary capillary blood distribution. Several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques either dependent on exogenous contrast materials, exploiting periodical lung signal variations with cardiac action, or relying on intrinsic lung voxel attributes have been demonstrated to visualize lung perfusion. Additional post-processing may add temporal information and provide quantitative information related to blood flow. The most widely used and robust technique, dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI, is available in clinical routine assessment of COPD, CF, and pulmonary vascular disease. Non-contrast techniques are important research tools currently requiring clinical validation and cross-correlation in the absence of a viable standard of reference.

These eosinophils release mediators and cytokines, contributing to severe airway inflammation and tissue damage. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting eosinophils could reduce airway remodeling and slow the progression of asthma.

Additionally, we sought to explore the associations of serum YKL-40 and DPP4 levels with asthma characteristics and conventional markers. A real-world observational cross-sectional study was conducted, involving a total of 75 adult asthma patients. We collected general information, including demographics and medical history. Measurements included complete blood count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), post-bronchodilator spirometry, serum YKL-40 and serum DPP4 levels. Asthma endotypes, T2-high and T2-low, were defined through a comprehensive review of existing literature and expert group discussions. Logistic and linear regression models were employed. Our findings indicated no significant association between serum YKL-40 or serum DPP4 levels and T2-high asthma across all models.

The intimate spatial relationship between neurons and immune cells suggests that their interactions play a pivotal role in regulating allergic airway inflammation. Upon direct activation by allergens, neurons and immune cells engage in interactions, during which neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released by neurons modulate immune cell activity. Meanwhile, immune cells release inflammatory mediators such as histamine and cytokines, stimulating neurons and amplifying neuropeptide production, thereby exacerbating allergic inflammation. The dynamic interplay between the nervous and immune systems suggests that targeting the neuro-immune axis in the airway could represent a novel approach to treating allergic airway diseases.

The disparities observed between urban and rural residents encompass numerous morbidity and mortality measures for several chronic diseases and have been referred to as the \"rural mortality penalty.\" Although the unmet health needs of rural communities are widely acknowledged, little is known about rural health disparities in allergies, asthma, and immunologic diseases. Furthermore, the intersection between rural health disparities and social determinants of health has not been fully explored. To achieve a more complete understanding of the factors that perpetuate rural health disparities, greater research efforts followed by improved practice and policy are needed that account for the complex social context within rural communities rather than a general comparison between urban and rural environments or focusing on biomedical factors. Moreover, research efforts must prioritize community inclusion throughout rural areas through meaningful engagement of stakeholders in both clinical care and research. In this review, we examine the scope of health disparities in the rural United States and the\u00a0impact of social determinants of health.
