Various types of IMCAs have been identified, including post-infectious cerebellitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, gluten ataxia, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus and myoclonus syndrome, and anti-GAD ataxia. In some cases, identification of several well-characterized autoantibodies points to a specific etiology in IMCAs and leads to a firm diagnosis. In other cases, various autoantibodies have been reported, but their interpretation requires a careful consideration. Indeed, some autoantibodies have only been documented in a limited number of cases and the causal relationship is not established. In order to facilitate an early treatment and prevent irreversible lesions, new entities have been defined in recent years, such as primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) and latent autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (LACA). PACA is characterized by autoimmune features which do not align with traditional etiologies, while LACA corresponds to a prodromal stage. LACA does not imply the initiation of an immunotherapy but requires a close follow-up. Concurrently, accumulation of clinical data has led to intriguing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of autoimmunity, such as a pathogenesis of autoimmunity against synapses (synaptopathies), and the vulnerability of the entire nervous system when the immunity targets ion channels and astrocytes. The development of PCD in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors suggests that molecular mimicry specifically determines the direction of autoimmunity, and that the strength of this response is modulated by co-signaling molecules that either enhance or dampen signals from the antigen-specific T cell receptor.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39052041/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "38771545", "Title": "Potential Clinical Benefit of Very Long Chain Fatty Acid Supplementation in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34.", "Abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is a dominantly inherited disease that causes late-onset ataxia, in association with skin lesions in the form of erythrokeratodermia variabilis.

We consider this novel, segregating POLG2 variant as disease-causing in this family. Moreover, we systematically screened the literature for POLG2-linked phenotypes and re-evaluated all mutations published to date for pathogenicity according to current knowledge. Thereby, we identified twelve published, likely disease-causing variants in 19 patients only. The core features included progressive ophthalmoplegia and cerebellar ataxia; parkinsonism, neuropathy, cognitive decline, and seizures were also repeatedly found in adult-onset heterozygous POLG2-related disease. A severe phenotype relates to biallelic\u00a0pathogenic variants in POLG2,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0newborn-onset liver failure, referred to as mitochondrial depletion syndrome.

SCA11 is caused by variants in TTBK2, which encodes tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) protein. Only a few families with SCA11 were described to date, all harbouring small deletions or insertions that result in frameshifts and truncated TTBK2 proteins. In addition, TTBK2 missense variants were also reported but they were either benign or still needed functional validation to ascertain their pathogenic potential in SCA11. The mechanisms behind cerebellar neurodegeneration mediated by TTBK2 pathogenic alleles are not clearly established. There is only one neuropathological report and a few functional studies in cell or animal models published to date. Moreover, it is still unclear whether the disease is caused by TTBK2 haploinsufficiency of by a dominant negative effect of TTBK2 truncated forms on the normal allele. Some studies point to a lack of kinase activity and mislocalization of mutated TTBK2, while others reported a disruption of normal TTBK2 function caused by SCA11 alleles, particularly during ciliogenesis. Although TTBK2 has a proven function in cilia formation, the phenotype caused by heterozygous TTBK2 truncating variants are not clearly typical of ciliopathies. Thus, other cellular mechanisms may explain the phenotype seen in SCA11.

Consequently, affected individuals ultimately become wheelchair dependent, require constant care, and face a shortened life expectancy. The monogenic cause of MJD is expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat region within the ATXN3 gene, which results in polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion within the resultant ataxin-3 protein. While it is well established that the ataxin-3 protein functions as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme and is therefore critically involved in proteostasis, several unanswered questions remain regarding the impact of polyQ expansion in ataxin-3 on its DUB function. Here we review the current literature surrounding ataxin-3's DUB function, its DUB targets, and what is known regarding the impact of polyQ expansion on ataxin-3's DUB function. We also consider the potential neuroprotective effects of ataxin-3's DUB function, and the intersection of ataxin-3's role as a DUB enzyme and regulator of gene transcription. Ataxin-3 is the principal pathogenic protein in MJD and also appears to be involved in cancer. As aberrant deubiquitination has been linked to both neurodegeneration and cancer, a comprehensive understanding of ataxin-3's DUB function is important for elucidating potential therapeutic targets in these complex conditions.

Out of all the characterized (>50) SCAs, 14 SCAs are caused due to microsatellite repeat expansion mutations. Repeat expansions can result in toxic protein gain-of-function, protein loss-of-function, and/or RNA gain-of-function effects. The location and the nature of mutation modulate the underlying disease pathophysiology resulting in varying disease manifestations. Potential toxic effects of these mutations likely affect key major cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial functioning, ion channel dysfunction and synaptic transmission. Involvement of several common pathways suggests interlinked function of genes implicated in the disease pathogenesis. A better understanding of the shared and distinct molecular pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases is required to develop targeted therapeutic tools and interventions for disease management.

Cough hypersensitivity has developed as a paradigm that helps to explain clinical and research observations that frequently\u00a0point towards chronic cough as a neuropathic disorder. Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a recently described neurological condition whose clinical features include gait ataxia, unsteadiness, peripheral neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction. Chronic cough is also a common feature\u00a0of the syndrome, with features of hypersensitivity, often preceding core neurological symptoms by up to 30 years or more. The genetic basis in a majority of cases of CANVAS appears to be biallelic variable repeat intron expansion sequences within RFC1, a gene normally involved in the regulation of DNA replication and repair. The same polymorphism has now been identified at an increased frequency in patients with unexplained or refractory chronic cough in the absence of defining clinical features of CANVAS. This review expands on these points, aiming to increase the awareness of CANVAS amongst clinicians and researchers working with chronic cough. We discuss the implications of a link between RFC1 disease and cough.

HiCS has distinct clinical findings and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

In brains of MSA patients, the hallmark lesion is the aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. Even though the underlying pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood, the evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein aggregation in oligodendrocytes may contribute to the neurodegeneration seen in MSA. The primary aim of this review is to summarise the published stereological data on the total number of neurons and glial cell subtypes (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia) and volumes in brains from MSA patients. Thus, we include in this review exclusively the reports of unbiased quantitative data from brain regions including the neocortex, nuclei of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. Furthermore, we compare and discuss the stereological results in the context of imaging findings and MSA symptomatology. In general, the stereological results agree with the common neuropathological findings of neurodegeneration and gliosis in brains from MSA patients and support a major loss of nigrostriatal neurons in MSA patients with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), as well as olivopontocerebellar atrophy in MSA patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). Surprisingly, the reports indicate only a minor loss of oligodendrocytes in sub-cortical regions of the cerebrum (glial cells not studied in the cerebellum) and negligible changes in brain volumes. In the past decades, the use of stereological methods has provided a vast amount of accurate information on cell numbers and volumes in the brains of MSA patients.

Early clinical reports, as well as physiological and behavioral studies in animal models, raised the possibility of a nonmotor role for the cerebellum. Anatomical studies demonstrate cerebellar connectivity with the distributed neural circuits linked with autonomic, sensorimotor, vestibular, associative and limbic/paralimbic brain areas. Identification of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome in adults and children underscored the clinical relevance of the role of the cerebellum in cognition and emotion. It opened new avenues of investigation into higher order deficits that accompany the ataxias and other cerebellar diseases, as well as the contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders. Brain imaging studies demonstrate the complexity of cerebellar functional topography, revealing a double representation of the sensorimotor cerebellum in the anterior lobe and lobule VIII and a triple cognitive representation in the cerebellar posterior lobe, as well as representation in the cerebellum of the intrinsic connectivity networks identified in the cerebral hemispheres. This paradigm shift in thinking about the cerebellum has been advanced by the theories of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform, harmonizing the dual anatomic realities of homogeneously repeating cerebellar cortical microcircuitry set against the heterogeneous and topographically arranged cerebellar connections with extracerebellar structures.

Anoctamins manifest ion channel and phospholipid scrambling activities and are involved in many physiological processes such as cell division, migration, apoptosis, cell signalling, and developmental processes. Several diseases, including neurological, muscle, blood disorders, and cancer, have been associated with the anoctamin family proteins. ANO10, which is the main focus of the present review, exhibits both scrambling and chloride channel activity; calcium availability is necessary for protein activation in either case. Additional processes implicating ANO10 include endosomal sorting, spindle assembly, and calcium signalling. Dysregulation of calcium signalling in Purkinje cells due to ANO10 defects is proposed as the main mechanism leading to spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive type 10 (SCAR10), a rare, slowly progressive spinocerebellar ataxia.

This study reported a large ACA series in China and described its etiology and clinical characteristics. We reviewed all ACA patients from our hospital (2013-2021) and analyzed their clinical and paraclinical features, treatment, and outcome. ACA subtypes investigated included paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA), anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-associated cerebellar ataxia, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), and ACA-associated with autoimmune encephalitis. A total of 127 patients were identified and 40.9% were male. The median onset age was 47.0\u00a0years. Gait ataxia was the most prevalent feature followed by limb ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria/dysphagia. Extracerebellar manifestations included pyramidal signs (28.3%) and peripheral neuropathy/radiculopathy (15.0%). ACA subtypes were PCD (30.7%), PACA (37.8%), ACA associated with autoimmune encephalitis (12.6%), anti-GAD-associated ACA (8.7%), MFS (7.1%), and OMS (3.1%).

While SCA31 is the third most prevalent autosomal dominant ataxia in Japan, it is extremely rare in other countries. A literature review was conducted on PubMed, where we included all case reports and studies describing the clinical presentation of original SCA31 cases. The clinical and radiological features of 374 patients issued from 25 studies were collected. This review revealed that the average age of onset was 59.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0years, with symptoms of slowly progressing ataxia and dysarthria. Other common clinical features were oculomotor dysfunction (38.8%), dysphagia (22.1%), hypoacousia (23.3%), vibratory hypoesthesia (24.3%), and dysreflexia (41.6%). Unfrequently, abnormal movements (7.4%), extrapyramidal symptoms (4.5%) and cognitive impairment (6.9%) may be observed. Upon radiological examination, clinicians can expect a high prevalence of cerebellar atrophy (78.7%), occasionally accompanied by brainstem (9.1%) and cortical (9.1%) atrophy.

The three cornerstones of clinical ataxia have emerged from studies on connectional anatomy and from clinical/neuropsychological observations, leading to the definition of clinical syndromes encountered in daily practice: (a) the cerebellar motor syndrome (CMS), (b) the vestibulocerebellar syndrome (VCS), and (c) the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome/Schmahmann syndrome (CCAS/SS). These syndromes are either isolated or coexist, depending on the underlying pathological process and its degree of extension within the cerebellum. Dysmetria is the core feature of cerebellar deficits, encompassing motor dysmetria (hypermetria, hypometria) in CMS, oculomotor dysmetria in VCS, and dysmetria of thought in CCAS/SS. The leading hypothesis is that dysmetria results from errors in building or maintaining internal models, which are inherent to predictive behavior. Errors in prediction would lead to clumsiness and incoordination of limbs, oculomotor impairments, and aberrant cognitive/affective behavior.

The clinical manifestations observed in these diseases could be as varied as the abnormalities in motor function observed in those who have Huntington's disease (HD) as demonstrated by a chorea with substantial degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) or those with various forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) with an ataxic motor presentation primarily due to degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Due to the very significant nature of the degeneration of MSNs in HD and Purkinje cells in SCAs, much of the research has centered around understanding the cell autonomous mechanisms dysregulated in these neuronal cell types. However, an increasing number of studies have revealed that dysfunction in non-neuronal glial cell types contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases.

The causative gene for SCA2 is ATXN2. The ataxin-2 protein is involved in RNA metabolism; the polyQ expansion may interrupt ataxin-2 interaction with its molecular targets, thus representing a loss-of-function mutation. However, mutant ataxin-2 protein also displays the features of gain-of-function mutation since it forms the aggregates in SCA2 cells and also enhances the IP3-induced calcium release in affected neurons. The cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are primarily affected in SCA2. Their tonic pacemaker activity is crucial for the proper cerebellar functioning. Disturbances in PC pacemaking are observed in many ataxic disorders. The abnormal intrinsic pacemaking was reported in mouse models of episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, Huntington's disease (HD), and in some other murine models of the disorders associated with the cerebellar degeneration. In our studies using SCA2-58Q transgenic mice via cerebellar slice recording and in vivo recording from urethane-anesthetized mice and awake head-fixed mice, we have demonstrated the impaired firing frequency and irregularity of PCs in these mice. PC pacemaker activity is regulated by SK channels. The pharmacological activation of SK channels has demonstrated some promising results in the electrophysiological experiments on EA2, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, HD mice, and also on mutant CACNA1A mice. In our studies, we have reported that the SK activators CyPPA and NS309 converted bursting activity into tonic, while oral treatment with CyPPA and NS13001 significantly improved motor performance and PC morphology in SCA2 mice. The i.p. injections of chlorzoxazone (CHZ) during in vivo recording sessions converted bursting cells into tonic in anesthetized SCA2 mice.

The discovery of several neural antibodies represents an undeniable contribution to this field, especially those serving as good biomarkers of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes and those showing direct pathogenic effects. Yet, many patients still lack detectable or known antibodies, and also many antibodies have only been reported in few patients, which makes it difficult to define in detail their clinical value. Nevertheless, a notable progress has additionally been made in the clinical characterization of patients with the main neural antibodies, which, although typically present with a subacute pancerebellar syndrome, may also show either hyperacute or chronic onsets that complicate the differential diagnoses. However, prodromal and transient features could be useful clues for an early recognition, and extracerebellar involvement may also be highly indicative of the associated antibody. Moreover, important advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxias include the description of antibody effects, especially those targeting cell-surface antigens, and first attempts to isolate antigen-specific T-cells. Furthermore, genetic predisposition seems relevant, although differently involved according to cancer association, with particular HLA observed in non-paraneoplastic cases and genetic abnormalities in the tumor cells in paraneoplastic ones. Finally, immune checkpoint inhibitors used as cancer immunotherapy may rarely induce cerebellar ataxias, but even this undesirable effect may in turn serve to shed some light on their physiopathology.

SCA1 is caused by an increase in the number of CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene leading to an expanded polyQ tract in the ATAXIN-1 protein. ATAXIN-1 is broadly expressed throughout the brain. However, until recently, SCA1 research has primarily centered on the cerebellum, given the characteristic cerebellar Purkinje cell loss observed in patients, as well as the progressive motor deficits, including gait and limb incoordination, that SCA1 patients present with. There are, however, also other symptoms such as respiratory problems, cognitive defects and memory impairment, anxiety, and depression observed in SCA1 patients and mouse models, which indicate that there are extra-cerebellar effects of SCA1 that cannot be explained solely through changes in the cerebellar region of the brain alone. The existing gap between human and mouse model studies of extra-cerebellar regions in SCA1 makes it difficult to answer many important questions in the field. This review will cover both the cerebellar and extra-cerebellar effects of SCA1 and highlight the need for further investigations into the impact of mutant ATXN1 expression in these regions.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane particles that are released from cells, including exosomes, microvesicles, and other extracellular particles. Recent studies have suggested that the PolyQ proteins, which are the disease-causative proteins of PolyQ diseases, and its aggregates are secreted via EVs, similar to the aggregation-prone proteins associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The PolyQ proteins that are secreted from cells can transmit intercellularly, which may contribute to pathological propagation of the PolyQ protein aggregates in patient brain, and therefore, the pathological roles of EVs in the onset and progression of PolyQ diseases has attracted much attention. EVs may also mediate intercellular transfer of heat shock proteins and other neuroprotective factors, which are beneficial for protein homeostasis and cell survival, and thus, have therapeutic potential for the neurodegenerative diseases including PolyQ diseases. Furthermore, because EVs contain not only the disease-associated proteins, but also various proteins, miRNAs and other components, and changes in the levels of these contents might reflect pathological changes, EVs derived from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine would be a potential source of minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers that report disease-associated changes in PolyQ diseases. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the pathological roles of EVs in PolyQ diseases, and therapeutic and diagnostic potential of EVs for these diseases.

Its clinical symptoms are mainly characterized by the absence of voluntary muscle coordination and loss of control of movement with varying manifestations due to differences in severity, in the site of cerebellar damage and in the involvement of extracerebellar tissues. Cerebellar ataxia may be sporadic, acquired, and hereditary. Hereditary ataxia accounts for the majority of cases. Hereditary ataxia has been tentatively divided into several subtypes by scientists in the field, and nearly all of them remain incurable. This is mainly because the detailed mechanisms of these cerebellar disorders are incompletely understood. To precisely diagnose and treat these diseases, studies on their molecular mechanisms have been conducted extensively in the past. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that some common pathogenic mechanisms exist within each subtype of inherited ataxia. However, no reports have indicated whether there is a common mechanism among the different subtypes of inherited cerebellar ataxia. In this review, we summarize the available references and databases on neurological disorders characterized by cerebellar ataxia and show that a subset of genes involved in lipid homeostasis form a new group that may cause ataxic disorders through a common mechanism.

In this review, we discuss the differential diagnosis of the intersection between peripheral nerve and cerebellar involvement, and classify them in accordance with the predominant features. Genetics, clinical features, neuroimaging, and neurophysiologic characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, a diagnostic approach for cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy is proposed according to the different clinical characteristics. This is an Educational and Descriptive review with the aim of medical education for the approach to the patients with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. The diagnostic approach to the patient with cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy requires a detailed medical history, phenotyping, characterization of disease progression and family history. Neuroimaging features and the neurophysiological findings play pivotal roles in defining the diagnosis. Establishing an organized classification method for the disorders based on the clinical features may be very helpful, and could be divided as those with predominant cerebellar features, predominant neuropathic feature, or conditions with both cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. Second, determining the mode of inheritance is critical on cerebellar ataxias: autosomal dominant and recessive cerebellar ataxias, mitochondrial or sporadic types.

While lineage-tracing studies have shown that phenotypically modulated smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the major cellular component of neointimal lesions, the cellular origins and microenvironmental signalling mechanisms that underlie remodelling along the adventitial vascular layer are not fully understood. However, a growing body of evidence supports a unique population of adventitial lineage-restricted progenitor cells expressing the stem cell marker, stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1; AdvSca1 cells) as important effectors of adventitial remodelling and suggests that they are at least partially responsible for subsequent pathological changes that occur in the media and intima. AdvSca1 cells are being studied in murine models of atherosclerosis, perivascular fibrosis, and neointima formation in response to acute vascular injury. Depending on the experimental conditions, AdvSca1 cells exhibit the capacity to differentiate into SMCs, endothelial cells, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and pro-remodelling cells, such as myofibroblasts and macrophages. These data indicate that AdvSca1 cells may be a targetable cell population to influence the outcomes of pathologic vascular remodelling. Important questions remain regarding the origins of AdvSca1 cells and the essential signalling mechanisms and microenvironmental factors that regulate both maintenance of their stem-like, progenitor phenotype and their differentiation into lineage-specified cell types.

On the other hand, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-\u03baB, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and receptor tyrosine kinase-associated mediators are main targets of candidate phytochemicals in the autocrine senescence pathway. Such a regulatory role of phytochemicals on senescence-associated pathways is associated with cell cycle arrest and the attenuation of apoptotic/inflammatory/oxidative stress pathways. The current systematic review highlights the critical roles of natural secondary metabolites in the attenuation of autocrine and paracrine cellular senescence pathways, while also elucidating the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic capabilities of these compounds.

Nevertheless, some rare forms of parkinsonism have ataxia as one of the main features in their clinical picture, especially those with juvenile or early-onset. On the other side, in cerebellar degenerative diseases, parkinsonism might accompany the typical symptoms and even become predominant in some cases. Many disorders involving different neurological systems present with a movement phenomenology reflecting the underlying pattern of pathological involvement, such as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, neurodegeneration associated with calcium deposition, and metabolic and mitochondrial disorders. The prototype of sporadic disorders that present with a constellation of symptoms due to the involvement of multiple Central Nervous System regions is multiple system atrophy, whose motor symptoms at onset can be cerebellar ataxia or parkinsonism. Clinical syndromes encompassing both parkinsonian and cerebellar features might represent a diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Recognizing acquired and potentially treatable causes responsible for complex movement disorders is of paramount importance, since an early diagnosis is essential to prevent permanent consequences. The present review aims to provide a pragmatic overview of the most common diseases characterized by the coexistence of cerebellar and parkinsonism features and suggests a possible diagnostic approach for both inherited and sporadic disorders.

Otherwise, competence and confidence in performing the clinical assessment relies heavily on the skill and experience of the clinician. Potentially, instrumented objective measurement will more accurately assess the severity of ataxia and the changes brought about by advancing therapies in pharmaceutical trials and in rehabilitation intervention. This study describes instrumented versions of several bedside tests of cerebellar function, including rhythmic tapping of the hand (RTH), finger-nose test (FNT), dysdiadochokinesia (DDK), ramp tracking (RMT), ballistic tracking (BT), rhythmic tapping of the foot (RTF) and the heel shin (HST) examination which were validated against scores from Ataxia Rating Scales (ARS) such as the Scale of Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). While all of the instrumented tests accurately distinguished between ataxic subjects and controls, there was a difference in performance, with the best four performing upper limb tests being RTH, FNT, DDK and BT. A combination of BT plus RTH provided the best correlation with the SARA and outperformed a combination of all the bedside tests (Spearman 0.8; p < 0.001 compared to 0.68; p < 0.001 for the combined set) in identifying the presence and severity of ataxia. This indicates that there is redundancy in the information provided by the bedside tests and that adding other tests to BT plus RTH does not add accuracy to the assessment of ataxia. This analysis highlighted the need for metrics that could be generalised to each of the assessments of ataxia, so, in turn, domains of stability, timing, accuracy and rhythmicity (STAR domains) were developed and compared to the SARA.

Lastly, we have conducted an exploratory survey study to map SCA-specific expertise, resources, and management in various Asian countries. This showed large differences in accessibility, genetic testing facilities, and treatment options between lower and higher income Asian countries.

The protocols of anodal cerebellar tDCS that improved movements in patients commonly placed the anode over the whole cerebellum and provided ten 2-mA 20-min stimulation sessions. The results may show preliminary evidence that anodal cerebellar tDCS is beneficial to reducing disease severity and improving finger dexterity and quality of life in patients, which lays the groundwork for future studies further examining responses in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway.

It was first outlined by the neurootology/neurophysiology community in the vestibular areflexic patients, through the description of patients slowly developing late-onset cerebellar ataxia and bilateral vestibulopathy. The characteristic deficit of visuo-vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) due to the impaired slow stabilizing eye movements was put forward and a specific disease subtending this syndrome was suggested. The association to a peripheral sensory axonal neuropathy was described later on, with neuropathological studies demonstrating that both sensory neuropathy and vestibular areflexia were diffuse ganglionopathy. Clinical and electrophysiological criteria of CANVAS were then proposed in 2016. Besides the classical triad, frequent chronic cough, signs of dysautonomia and neurogenic pains were frequently observed. From the beginning of published cohorts, sporadic as well as familial cases were reported, the last suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The genetic disorder was discovered in 2019, under the form of abnormal biallelic expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) in a population of late-onset ataxia. This pathological expansion was found in 100% of the familial form and 92% of sporadic ones when the triad was complete. But using the genetic criteria, the phenotype of CANVAS seems to expand, for exemple including patients with isolated neuronopathy.

Cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to ethanol, both during development and at the adult stage. In adults, chronic alcoholism elicits, in particular, cerebellar vermis atrophy, the anterior lobe of the cerebellum being highly vulnerable. Alcohol-dependent patients develop gait ataxia and lower limb postural tremor. Prenatal exposure to ethanol causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), characterized by permanent congenital disabilities in both motor and cognitive domains, including deficits in general intelligence, attention, executive function, language, memory, visual perception, and communication/social skills. Children with FASD show volume deficits in the anterior lobules related to sensorimotor functions (Lobules I, II, IV, V, and VI), and lobules related to cognitive functions (Crus II and Lobule VIIB). Various mechanisms underlie ethanol-induced cell death, with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress being the main pro-apoptotic mechanisms in alcohol abuse and FASD. Oxidative and ER stresses are induced by thiamine deficiency, especially in alcohol abuse, and are exacerbated by neuroinflammation, particularly in fetal ethanol exposure. Furthermore, exposure to ethanol during the prenatal period interferes with neurotransmission, neurotrophic factors and retinoic acid-mediated signaling, and reduces the number of microglia, which diminishes expected cerebellar development.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene is silenced when cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) triplet repeats exceed 200, which is the full mutation that causes FXS. Carriers of FXS have a CGG repeat between 55 and 200, which is defined as a premutation and transcription of the gene is overactive with high levels of the FMR1 mRNA. Most carriers of the premutation have normal levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and a normal intelligence, but in the upper range of the premutation (120-200) the FMRP level may be lower than normal. The clinical problems associated with the premutation are caused by the RNA toxicity associated with increased FMR1 mRNA levels, although for some mildly lowered FMRP can cause problems associated with FXS.

Anatomical studies demonstrate cerebellar connectivity with the distributed neural circuits linked with autonomic, sensorimotor, vestibular, associative, and limbic/paralimbic brain areas. Identification of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome in adults and children underscored the clinical relevance of the role of the cerebellum in cognition and emotion. It opened new avenues of investigation into higher-order deficits that accompany the ataxias and other cerebellar diseases, as well as the contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders. Brain imaging studies have demonstrated the complexity of cerebellar functional topography, revealing a double representation of the sensorimotor cerebellum in the anterior lobe and lobule VIII and a triple cognitive representation in the cerebellar posterior lobe, as well as representation in the cerebellum of the intrinsic connectivity networks identified in the cerebral hemispheres.

Genetic deficiencies, copy number variants, and single nucleotide variants of FAN1 have been linked to karyomegalic interstitial nephritis, 15q13.3 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome (autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy), cancer, and most recently repeat expansion diseases. For seven CAG repeat expansion diseases (Huntington's disease (HD) and certain spinocerebellar ataxias), modification of age of onset is linked to variants of specific DNA repair proteins. FAN1 variants are the strongest modifiers. Non-coding disease-delaying FAN1 variants and coding disease-hastening variants (p.R507H and p.R377W) are known, where the former may lead to increased FAN1 levels and the latter have unknown effects upon FAN1 functions. Current thoughts are that ongoing repeat expansions in disease-vulnerable tissues, as individuals age, promote disease onset. Fan1 is required to suppress against high levels of ongoing somatic CAG and CGG repeat expansions in tissues of HD and FMR1 transgenic mice respectively, in addition to participating in DNA interstrand crosslink repair. FAN1 is also a modifier of autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Coupled with the association of these diseases with repeat expansions, this suggests a common mechanism, by which FAN1 modifies repeat diseases.

The inherited CAG length is known to expand further in somatic and germline cells in HD subjects. Age at onset of the disease is inversely correlated with the inherited CAG length, but is further modulated by a series of genetic modifiers which are most likely to act on the CAG repeat in HTT that permit it to further expand. Longer repeats are more prone to expansions, and this expansion is age dependent and tissue-specific. Given that the inherited tract expands through life and most subjects develop disease in mid-life, this implies that in cells that degenerate, the CAG length is likely to be longer than the inherited length. These findings suggest two thresholds- the inherited CAG length which permits further expansion, and the intracellular pathogenic threshold, above which cells become dysfunctional and die. This two-step mechanism has been previously proposed and modelled mathematically to give an intracellular pathogenic threshold at a tract length of 115 CAG (95% confidence intervals 70- 165 CAG). Empirically, the intracellular pathogenic threshold is difficult to determine. Clues from studies of people and models of HD, and from other diseases caused by expanded repeat tracts, place this threshold between 60- 100 CAG, most likely towards the upper part of that range. We assess this evidence and discuss how the intracellular pathogenic threshold in manifest disease might be better determined.

DNA damage repair in neurons does not rely on DNA replication correction mechanisms. However, there is a strong connection between DNA repair and neuronal metabolism, mediated by nucleotide salvaging and the poly ADP-ribose (PAR) response, and this connection has been implicated in other age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Validation of leads including the mismatch repair protein MSH3, and interstrand cross-link repair protein FAN1, suggest the mechanism is driven by somatic CAG instability, which is supported by the protective effect of CAA substitutions in the CAG tract.

Ataxi A-T elangiectasia (A-T) is a prominent example of this process. A-T's hallmarks are progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chronic lung disease, cancer predisposition, endocrine abnormalities, segmental premature aging, chromosomal instability and radiation sensitivity. The disease is caused by absence of the powerful protein kinase, ATM, best known as the mobilizer of the broad signaling network induced by double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA. In parallel, ATM also functions in the maintenance of the cellular redox balance, mitochondrial function and turnover and many other metabolic circuits. An ongoing discussion in the A-T field revolves around the question of which ATM function is the one whose absence is responsible for the most debilitating aspect of A-T - the cerebellar degeneration. This review suggests that it is the absence of a comprehensive role of ATM in responding to ongoing DNA damage induced mainly by endogenous agents.

Generally, the SCAs are characterized by a progressive gait impairment with classical cerebellar features, and in a subset of SCAs, accompanied by extra-cerebellar features. Beyond the common gait impairment and cerebellar atrophy, the wide range of additional clinical features observed across the SCAs is likely explained by the diverse set of mutated genes that encode proteins with seemingly disparate functional roles in nervous system biology. By synthesizing knowledge obtained from studies of the various SCAs over the past several decades, convergence onto a few key cellular changes, namely ion channel dysfunction and transcriptional dysregulation, has become apparent and may represent central mechanisms of cerebellar disease pathogenesis.

Patients with episodic ataxia exhibit recurrent episodes of ataxia, including motor dysmetria. Despite the consensus that cerebellar dysmetria is a cardinal symptom, there is still no agreement on its pathophysiological mechanisms to date since its first clinical description by Babinski. We argue that impairment in the predictive computation for voluntary movements explains a range of characteristics accompanied by dysmetria. Within this framework, the cerebellum acquires and maintains an internal forward model, which predicts current and future states of the body by integrating an estimate of the previous state and a given efference copy of motor commands. Two of our recent studies experimentally support the internal-forward-model hypothesis of the cerebellar circuitry. First, the cerebellar outputs (firing rates of dentate nucleus cells) contain predictive information for the future cerebellar inputs (firing rates of mossy fibers). Second, a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motions in control subjects. In cerebellar patients, the predictive component lags behind a target motion and is compensated with a feedback component. Furthermore, a clinical analysis has examined kinematic and electromyography (EMG) features using a task of elbow flexion goal-directed movements, which mimics the finger-to-nose test. Consistent with the hypothesis of the internal forward model, the predictive activations in the triceps muscles are impaired, and the impaired predictive activations result in hypermetria (overshoot). Dysmetria stems from deficits in the predictive computation of the internal forward model in the cerebellum. Errors in this fundamental mechanism result in undershoot (hypometria) and overshoot during voluntary motor actions. The predictive computation of the forward model affords error-based motor learning, coordination of multiple degrees of freedom, and adequate timing of muscle activities. Both the timing and synergy theory fit with the internal forward model, microzones being the elemental computational unit, and the anatomical organization of converging inputs to the Purkinje neurons providing them the unique property of a perceptron in the brain. We propose that motor dysmetria observed in attacks of ataxia occurs as a result of impaired predictive computation of the internal forward model in the cerebellum.", "Year": "2020", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32962256/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "32933108", "Title": "Disorders of Human Coenzyme Q10 Metabolism: An Overview.", "Abstract": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has a number of vital functions in all cells, both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial.

OPCA, now multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar ataxia, has characteristic brain imaging features and is clearly diagnosed based on the consensus criteria. On the other hand, there is no specific biomarker for LCCA/CCA, and neuropathological examination is required for a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of LCCA/CCA depends on the exclusion of other diseases manifesting as cerebellar ataxia. However the differential diagnosis for LCCA/CCA is not necessarily made carefully. As a result, the LCCA/CCA category in Japan is a \"waste basket,\" including OPCA, hereditary ataxias, and secondary ataxias, which are unidentified yet.

Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.

Many studies have demonstrated that such autoantibodies induce channel or receptor dysfunction. The same mechanism is discussed in immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs), but the pathogenesis has been less investigated. The aim of the present review is to evaluate what kind of cerebellar ion channels, their related proteins, and the synaptic machinery proteins that are preferably impaired by autoantibodies so as to develop cerebellar ataxias (CAs). The cerebellum predictively coordinates motor and cognitive functions through a continuous update of an internal model. These controls are relayed by cerebellum-specific functions such as precise neuronal discharges with potassium channels, synaptic plasticity through calcium signaling pathways coupled with voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 (mGluR1), a synaptic organization with glutamate receptor delta (GluR\u03b4), and output signal formation through chained GABAergic neurons. Consistently, the association of CAs with anti-potassium channel-related proteins, anti-VGCC, anti-mGluR1, and GluR\u03b4, and anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65 antibodies is observed in IMCAs. Despite ample distributions of AMPA and GABA receptors, however, CAs are rare in conditions with autoantibodies against these receptors. Notably, when the autoantibodies impair synaptic transmission, the autoimmune targets are commonly classified into three categories: release machinery proteins, synaptic adhesion molecules, and receptors.

Cerebellar brain inhibition reflects the magnitude of suppression of motor cortex excitability after stimulating the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere and therefore represents a neurophysiological marker of the integrity of the efferent cerebellar tract. Observations that cerebellar noninvasive stimulation techniques enhanced performance of certain motor and cognitive tasks in healthy individuals have inspired attempts to modulate cerebellar activity and connectivity in patients with cerebellar diseases in order to achieve clinical benefit. We here comprehensively explore the therapeutic potential of these techniques in two movement disorders characterized by prominent cerebellar involvement, namely the degenerative ataxias and essential tremor. The article aims to illustrate the (patho)physiological insights obtained from these studies and how these translate into clinical practice, where possible by addressing the association with cerebellar brain inhibition. Finally, possible explanations for some discordant interstudy findings, shortcomings in our current understanding, and recommendations for future research will be provided. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Their incidence, however, has probably been underestimated owing to their complex clinical manifestations. Sialidosis is a prototypical LSD inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene that result in a deficiency of alpha-N-acetyl neuraminidase 1 (NEU1). Two basic forms of this disease, type I and type II, are known. The dysmorphic type II form features LSD symptoms including congenital hydrops, dysmorphogenetic traits, hepato-splenomegaly and severe intellectual disability. The diagnosis is more challenging in the normosomatic type I forms, whose clinical findings at onset include ocular defects, ataxia and generalized myoclonus. Here we report the clinical, biochemical and molecular analysis of five patients with sialidosis type I. Two patients presented novel NEU1 mutations. One of these patients was compound heterozygous for two novel NEU1 missense mutations: c.530A>T (p.Asp177Val) and c.1010A>G (p.His337Arg), whereas a second patient was compound heterozygous for a known mutation and a novel c.839G>A (p.Arg280Gln) mutation. We discuss the impact of these new mutations on the structural properties of NEU1.

The underlying disease mechanism in the polyQ diseases is thought principally to reflect dominant toxic properties of the disease proteins which, when harboring a polyQ expansion, differentially interact with protein partners and are prone to aggregate. Among the polyQ diseases, SCA3 is the most common SCA, and second to HD in prevalence worldwide. Here we summarize current understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms within the broader context of the broader polyQ disease field. We emphasize properties of the disease protein, ATXN3, and new discoveries regarding three potential pathogenic mechanisms: 1) altered protein homeostasis; 2) DNA damage and dysfunctional DNA repair; and 3) nonneuronal contributions to disease.

We review the different pathways that have been linked to non-coding repeat expansion disorders such as C9ORF72-linked ALS/frontotemporal dementia (FTD), myotonic dystrophy, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), SCA, and Huntington's disease-like 2. We discuss modes of RNA toxicity focusing on the identity and the interacting partners of the toxic RNA species.

FMR1 premutations may associate with at least two other clinical conditions, named fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).

After a long pre-symptomatic period, this late-onset disease progressively disables patients and typically leads to premature death. Neuronal loss in specific regions of the cerebellum, brainstem and basal ganglia as well as the spinal cord explains the spectra of debilitating neurological symptoms, most strikingly progressive limb, and gait ataxia. The genetic cause of MJD is a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the gene that encodes ataxin-3. This polyQ-containing protein displays a well-defined catalytic activity as ataxin-3 is a deubiquitylating enzyme that removes and disassembles ubiquitin chains from specific substrates. While mutant ataxin-3 with an expanded polyQ repeat induces cellular stress due to its propensity to aggregate, the native functions of wild-type ataxin-3 are linked to the cellular countermeasures against the very same stress conditions inflicted by polyQ-containing and other aggregation-prone proteins. Hence, a mixture of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms are likely to contribute to the neuronal demise observed in MJD.
