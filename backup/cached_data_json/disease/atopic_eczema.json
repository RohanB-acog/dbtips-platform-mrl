{"/disease-profile/details/": {"data": {"diseases": {"id": "EFO_0000274", "name": "atopic eczema", "description": "Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis (AD), is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by impaired skin barrier function and immune dysregulation, often exacerbated by genetic and environmental factors. The pathophysiology involves a loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene, leading to increased transepidermal water loss and susceptibility to irritants and allergens, resulting in dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. Clinically, patients experience intense pruritus and may develop erythematous patches, lichenification, or even severe flares requiring systemic treatment. Despite available therapies, there is a significant unmet need for effective long-term management options that adequately control symptoms and improve the quality of life for individuals with moderate to severe AD.", "synonyms": [{"relation": "hasExactSynonym", "terms": ["atopic dermatitis and related conditions", "Other atopic dermatitis and related conditions", "Neurodermatitis, Disseminated",
