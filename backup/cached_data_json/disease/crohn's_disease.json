This article systematically reviews and compares data on clinical response rates, remission rates, adverse events, and shifts in bacterial microbiota. Among these studies, gut microbiome analysis was conducted in only 7, and a single study examined the metabolome. Overall, FMT has demonstrated a partial restoration of typical CD-associated microbiological alterations, leading to increased \u03b1-diversity in responders and a moderate shift in patient microbiota toward the donor profile. Several factors, including donor selection, delivery route, microbial state (fresh or frozen), and recipient condition, are identified as pivotal in influencing FMT's effectiveness. Future prospective clinical studies with larger patient cohorts and improved methodologies are imperative.

Enterohepatic fistulas, a rare but significant complication, are scarcely reported. This article presents the case of a hepatic abscess due to an enterohepatic fistula in a patient with long-term Crohn disease and reviews the existing literature on this phenomenon. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old female patient with a known history of Crohn disease and previous ileocolic resection due to enteroenteric fistulas presented to our Emergency Department with right-sided abdominal pain persisting for 10 days. Diagnostic investigations, including imaging, revealed an enterohepatic fistula with a 3-4 cm hepatic abscess in segment V of the liver. Initial management involved conservative treatment with radiological drainage and antibiotics, leading to the patient's discharge. An elective laparotomy was scheduled 1 month later. The patient underwent resection of the ileocolic anastomosis with ileotransverse re-anastomosis and catheter removal. Postoperative management included treatment for paralytic ileus. She was discharged in good condition on postoperative day 11. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the range of complications that can occur in patients with Crohn disease and presents the rare association between Crohn disease and enterohepatic fistula and abscess formation. Only 2 other case reports of enterohepatic fistula due to Crohn disease exist in the literature.

CD is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, influenced by genetic predisposition, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and environmental factors. Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating immune response and intestinal inflammation and is associated with the onset and progression of CD. Further, visceral adipose tissue, particularly creeping fat, a mesenteric adipose tissue characterized by hypertrophy and fibrosis, has been implicated in CD pathogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. The bacteria from the gut microbiota may translocate into mesenteric adipose tissue, contributing to the formation of creeping fat and influencing CD progression. Although creeping fat may be a protective barrier against bacterial invasion, its expansion can damage adjacent tissues, leading to complications. Modulating gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and prebiotics has shown potential in managing CD. However, more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms linking gut dysbiosis, creeping fat, and CD progression and develop targeted therapies for microbiota modulation and fat-related complications in patients with CD.", "Year": "2025", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Editorial"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39777251/", "Qualifers": ["microbiology", "immunology", "therapy"]}, {"PMID": "38547511", "Title": "Operating Properties of Disease Activity Indices in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Accurate, reliable, and responsive disease activity indices are important to streamline drug approval and treatment modalities for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD).

Similarities have been noted between the (histo)pathological presentation of MAP in ruminants, termed Johne's disease (JD), and appearances in humans with CD. Analyses of disease presentation and pathology suggest a multi-step process occurs that consists of MAP infection, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and dietary influences. Each step has a role in the disease development and requires a better understanding to implementing combination therapies, such as antibiotics, vaccination, faecal microbiota transplants (FMT) and dietary plans. To optimise responses, each must be tailored directly to the activity of MAP, otherwise therapies are open to interpretation without microbiological evidence that the organism is present and has been influenced. Microscopy and histopathology enables studies of the mycobacterium in situ and how the associated disease processes manifest in the patient e.g., granulomas, fissuring, etc. The challenge for researchers has been to prove the relationship between MAP and CD with available laboratory tests and methodologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), MAP-associated DNA sequences and bacteriological culture investigations. These have, so far, been inconclusive in revealing the relationship of MAP in patients with CD. Improved and accurate methods of detection will add to evidence for an infectious aetiology of CD.

Dietary therapy is also a tool for management of these conditions. Nutrition therapy for IBD has been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, promote healing, and alleviate symptoms, as well as improve patients' nutrition status. Although the mechanisms of action of most nutrition therapies for IBD are not well understood, the diets are theorized to eliminate triggers for gut dysbiosis and mucosal immune dysfunction associated with the typical Western diet. Exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's disease exclusion diet are increasingly being used as the primary treatment modality for the induction of remission and/or maintenance therapy in children, and in some adults, with CD. Several other diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, anti-inflammatory diet for IBD, and diets excluding gluten, FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols), lactose, or other compounds, may be helpful in symptom management in both CD and UC, though evidence for biochemical efficacy is limited.

Owing to their location in a portion of the gastrointestinal tract which is not easily accessible to conventional endoscopic techniques, the detection of CD-related small bowel cancers is still a clinical challenge. The radiological features of CD-related small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) in patients with CD have been described in some previous studies, including its appearance in both CT and MRI examinations. Radiological signs of active or fibrostenotic CD may be intermixed with those suggesting the presence of CD-related SBA. In CT studies, the most relevant findings consistent with malignant transformation are the presence of a stricture with irregular asymmetric thickening of small bowel walls, loss of mural stratification, and moderate enhancement after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast media, in association with enlarged adjacent mesenteric lymph nodes. Many of the CD-related SBA features that can be observed on CT imaging are similar to those detectable by MRI. This latter modality provides the additional value of the functional characterization of small bowel strictures, thereby helping to distinguish between inflammatory, fibrotic, and malignant stenosis in the setting of active CD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT enables the metabolic assessment of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and PET/MRI fusion imaging can incorporate morphological, functional and metabolic information into a single set of imaging data, thus overcoming the limitations of the separate assessment of each individual modality. Owing to the low incidence and prevalence of this long-term complication of CD, we believe that a detailed multimodality pictorial essay on this topic, also including the PET-CT and fusion imaging documentation of some cases, would be useful to the medical literature.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38441632/", "Qualifers": ["diagnostic imaging", "complications"]}, {"PMID": "38185396", "Title": "Comparative Efficacy of Advanced Therapies for Achieving Endoscopic Outcomes in Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.", "Abstract": "We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of advanced therapies for achieving endoscopic outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severely active Crohn's disease.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38185396/", "Qualifers": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy"]}, {"PMID": "37957477", "Title": "Excisional haemorrhoidectomy in Crohn's disease - is it time to question an old dogma?", "Abstract": "Haemorrhoidectomy in Crohn's disease is controversial due to fears over poor wound healing leading to proctectomy.

However, the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix within the bowel wall will end up in the formation of strictures, with the consequent need for surgery. A number of mechanisms have been described in this process, but some of them are not yet clear.

Nutrition is essential for maintaining the dynamic balance of intestinal eco-environments to ensure intestinal barrier and immune homeostasis, while this balance can be disrupted easily by maladjusted nutrition. Research has firmly established that nutrition has the potential to shape the composition and function of gut microbiota to affect the disease course. Unhealthy diet and eating disorders lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis and further destroy the function of intestinal barrier such as the disruption of membrane integrity and increased permeability, thereby triggering intestinal inflammation. Notably, appropriate nutritional interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet, can positively modulate intestinal microecology, which may provide a promising strategy for future IBD prevention. In this review, we provide insights into the interplay between nutrition and gut microbiota and its effects on IBD and present some previously overlooked lines of evidence regarding the role of derived metabolites in IBD processes, such as trimethylamine N-oxide and imidazole propionate.

Crohn's strictures can compose of inflammation, fibrosis or smooth muscle expansion and usually a combination of these. There have been numerous new developments in imaging modalities in determining the composition of Crohn's strictures. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the best upfront imaging modality to characterize Crohn's strictures. Gastrointestinal ultrasound (GIUS) has an increasing role in clinical practice, particularly for monitoring stricture response as a treat-to-target tool. Novel imaging techniques to differentiate between fibrosis and inflammatory strictures have been developed including contrast-enhanced GIUS, strain or shear wave elastography with GIUS and multiple new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols, including diffusion weighted, delayed contrast enhancement and magnetization transfer MR protocols. However, these techniques require further validation and standardization. Regarding therapeutics, anti-tumor necrosis agents with a treat-to-target strategy have the highest quality evidence in treating strictures and can lead to stricture regression in some cases.

The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE)-II guidelines specify short, intermediate, and long-term treatment goals, documenting specific treatment targets to be achieved at each of these timepoints. Scheduled appraisal of Crohn's disease activity against pre-defined treatment targets at these timepoints remains central to determining whether current therapy should be continued or modified. Consensus treatment targets in Crohn's disease comprise combination clinical and patient-reported outcome remission, in conjunction with biomarker normalisation and endoscopic healing. Although the STRIDE-II guidelines endorse the pursuit of endoscopic healing, clinicians must consider that this may not always be appropriate, acceptable, or achievable in all patients. This underscores the need to engage patients at the outset in an effort to personalise care and individualise treatment targets. The use of non-invasive biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging techniques, particularly intestinal ultrasound, holds great promise; as do emerging treatment targets such as transmural healing. Two randomised clinical trials, namely, CALM and STARDUST, have evaluated the efficacy of a T2T approach in achieving endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn's disease. Findings from these studies reflect that patient subgroups and Crohn's disease characteristics likely to benefit most from a T2T approach, remain to be clarified. Moreover, outside of clinical trials, data pertaining to the real-world effectiveness of a T2T approach remains scare, highlighting the need for pragmatic real-world studies. Despite the obvious promise of a T2T approach, a lack of guidance to support its integration into real-world clinical practice has the potential to limit its uptake.

Crohn's disease exhibits both a relapsing and progressive course, and its prevalence is on the rise globally, mirroring the trends of industrialization. While the precise pathogenesis of CD remains unknown, various factors including immune cell dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors have been implicated in disease etiology. Animal models, particularly ileitis mouse models, have provided valuable tools for studying the specific mechanisms underlying CD, allowing longitudinal assessment and sampling in interventional preclinical studies. Furthermore, animal models assess to evaluate the distinct role that bacterial and dietary antigens play in causing inflammation, using germ-free animals, involving the introduction of individual bacteria (monoassociation studies), and experimenting with well-defined dietary components. An ideal animal model for studying IBD, specifically CD, should exhibit an inherent intestinal condition that arises spontaneously and closely mimics the distinct transmural inflammation observed in the human disease, particularly in the terminal ileum.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is inflammatory disease restricted to the colon and rectum.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are tiny subcellular bodies with a phospholipid bilayer envelope containing bioactive molecules, which are released from different cells and are involved in intercellular communication. Recent pre-clinical data show their emerging role in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.

Early treatment in CD has been demonstrated to modify the natural history of the disease and potentially delay surgery. Previous reviews on this topic have borrowed their evidence from CD to make UC-specific recommendations. This review highlights the emergence of UC-specific data from larger cohort studies and a comprehensive individual patient data systemic review and meta-analysis to critically appraise evidence on the utility of early escalation to advanced therapies with respect to short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes. In UC, the utility of the early escalation concept for the purposes of changing the natural history, including reducing colectomy and hospitalizations, is not supported by the available data. Data on targeting clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological outcomes are needed to demonstrate that they are meaningful with regard to achieving reductions in hospitalization and surgery, improving quality of life, and minimizing disability. Analyses of different populations of UC patients, such as those with 'relapsing & remitting' disease or with severe or complicated disease course, are urgently needed. The costs and risk/benefit profile of some of the newer advanced therapies should be carefully considered.

There are many factors, e.g., genetic, environmental and immunological, that increase the likelihood of these diseases. Indicators of IBDs include extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The aim of this review is to present data on the role of selected cytokines and metalloproteinases in IBD. In recent years, more and more transcriptomic studies are emerging. These studies are improving the characterization of the cytokine microenvironment inside inflamed tissue. It is observed that the levels of several cytokines are consistently increased in inflamed tissue in IBD, both in UC and CD. This review shows that MMPs play a major role in the pathology of inflammatory processes, cancer, and IBD. IBD-associated inflammation is associated with increased expression of MMPs and reduced ability of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to inhibit their action. In IBD patients in tissues that are inflamed, MMPs are produced in excess and TIMP activity is not sufficient to block MMPs.

In Crohn's disease (CD), cytokine imbalance rules the intestinal microenvironment and leads to chronic inflammation of the gut. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are generally upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including TNF\u03b1 and IL-6. Consequently, drugs that target these cytokines have been long sought and approved. Despite the short-term success in treating CD patients with anti-TNF\u03b1, many patients stopped responding to treatment, which made IL-6 an alternative target to alleviate inflammation in these patients. IL-6 has long been approached as part of the therapeutic strategies to treat CD and other inflammatory disorders. Clinical trials of CD patients have targeted IL-6 signaling in different mechanisms: blocking IL-6, neutralizing IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), or trapping the soluble IL-6/IL-6R complex. These trials have faced challenges and side effects in patients with gastrointestinal perforations and ulcers, for example, all of which highlight the dual role of IL-6 during intestinal inflammation and the need for this cytokine for intestinal tissue integrity. IL-6 is involved in a complex of upstream regulators and downstream signaling cascades and maintaining a physiological level of IL-6 in the blood and in the intestine is key for achieving health and homeostasis.

Despite some progress in research on EIMs, for instance, ectopic expression of gut-specific mucosal address cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and chemokine CCL25 on the vascular endothelium of the portal tract have been demonstrated in IBD-related primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), little is understood about the potential pathophysiological associations between IBD and cutaneous EIMs. Whether cutaneous EIMs are inflammatory events with a commonly shared genetic background or environmental risk factors with IBD but independent of IBD or are the result of an extraintestinal extension of intestinal inflammation, remains unclear. The review aims to provide an overview of the two most representative cutaneous manifestations of IBD, describe IBD's epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and histology, and discuss the immunopathophysiology and existing treatment strategies with biologic agents, with a focus on the potential pathophysiological associations between IBD and cutaneous EIMs.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37954590/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy"]}, {"PMID": "37882852", "Title": "Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in distinguishing strictures in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing fibrotic from inflammatory strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", "Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37882852/", "Qualifers": ["complications", "diagnostic imaging"]}, {"PMID": "37879713", "Title": "Adalimumab-associated Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in a patient with Crohn's disease.", "Abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved TNF(Tumor necrosis factor) alpha inhibitors to manage a range of inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory disorders.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Stata 15 software and R 4.04 software. Two case-control studies and 12 cohort studies were eventually included. Colorectal stricture in patients with IBD increased the risk of progressing to CRN [odds ratio (OR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.29, P = 0.042], but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to ACRN (OR: 3.56, 95% CI 0.56-22.70, P = 0.180).

Here, we reviewed registers from 855 patients with Crohn's disease treated in our service from January 2007 to December 2020 and found 4 cases of duodenal fistula and 1 case of gastric fistula. CASE REPORT The fistula origin was in the ileocolic segment in all cases, and all of the patients underwent preoperative optimization with improvement of nutritional status and infection control. They then underwent surgical treatment with resection of the affected segment and duodenal or gastric closure with covering by an omental patch. One case of a duodenal fistula was complicated by duodenal dehiscence. This was treated surgically with duodenojejunostomy. Each of the other patients had an uneventful postoperative course. All patients were successfully cured of their gastroduodenal fistulas, and at the time of this publication, none of them died or had fistula recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Fistulas with the involvement of the stomach and duodenum in patients with Crohn's disease are almost always due to inflammation in the ileum, colon, or previous ileocolic anastomosis. Management of this situation is complex and often requires clinical and surgical assistance; preoperative optimization of the patient's general condition can improve the surgical results. The surgical approach is based on resection of the affected segment and gastric or duodenal closure with covering by an omental patch. Gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy can be performed in selected patients with larger defects and minor jejunal disease. To prevent recurrence, prophylactic therapy with anti-TNF agents and early endoscopic surveillance are also essential for successful treatment.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Review", "Case Reports", "Journal Article"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37661602/", "Qualifers": ["complications", "surgery"]}, {"PMID": "37787347", "Title": "Artificial intelligence in endoscopy: Overview, applications, and future directions.", "Abstract": "Since the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, endoscopy applications in gastroenterology have been at the forefront of innovations.

In the present article, we critically review available data on the role of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents and new biologics (including vedolizumab and ustekinumab) in the prevention and treatment of POR after surgery in CD. Several studies (summarised in various meta-analyses) have confirmed the efficacy of anti-TNFs in the prevention of POR. We identified 37 studies, including 1863 CD patients, with mean endoscopic POR at 6-12 months of 29%. Only few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have directly compared thiopurines and anti-TNFs, with controversial results, although the superiority of the latter is supported by several meta-analyses. Infliximab and adalimumab seem equally effective. The combination of anti-TNFs and immunosuppressives should be considered in patients previously exposed to anti-TNFs. Several studies have shown that anti-TNFs remain an effective option to prevent POR also in patients with anti-TNF failure before surgery. In fact, the use of the same anti-TNF before and after surgery might be effective for the prevention of POR. Prophylactic anti-TNF treatment, once started, should be continued long term. Anti-TNFs are also effective for the treatment of established POR. Retreatment with anti-TNFs for POR is a valid strategy even after their preoperative failure. In six studies (including 156 patients) evaluating vedolizumab, mean endoscopic POR at 6-12 months was 41%. The non-randomised comparison of anti-TNFs and vedolizumab has provided controversial results. One placebo-controlled RCT confirmed that vedolizumab is quite effective in preventing POR in CD patients with increased risk of recurrence. Seven studies (including 162 patients) evaluated ustekinumab, with a mean endoscopic POR at 6-12 months of 41%. The comparative efficacy of ustekinumab and anti-TNFs is still unclear. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab seem to be equally effective, although the experience is very limited. In conclusion, to date, anti-TNFs are the most effective agents in preventing and treating POR in CD.

There are two major IBD phenotypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC manifests as uninterrupted inflammation localized in the colon and rectum. Meanwhile, CD presents as interrupted inflammation that can occur throughout the digestive tract. As a result, therapeutics have focused on anti-inflammatory approaches for its treatment. Unfortunately, only 50% of patients benefit from current Food and Drug Administration approved treatments, and all are associated with serious adverse effects. Thus, there is a need for safer and novel therapeutics to increase the efficacy in this population. One aspect that is critical in understanding IBD is how food and phytochemicals therein may be associated with modifying the pathogenesis of IBD. A variety of retrospective and prospective studies, and clinical trials have shown benefits of plant-rich diets on the prevention and symptomatic improvement of IBD. The Mediterranean diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs; and characterized by the abundance of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals. An understudied phytochemical class enriched in this diet is terpenes; isoprene-based molecules are widely available in Mediterranean herbs and citrus fruits.

This review aims to investigate the connection between the oral and gut microbiome in the context of IBD, exploring the intricate interplay between these microbial communities and their impact on overall gut health. Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed a compelling link between the oral and gut microbiome, highlighting their pivotal role in maintaining overall health.

Although several paediatric indices and scales are well established (eg, IMPACT questionnaire, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI], and Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI]), recent years have seen the development of newer indices for children, including the Mucosal Inflammation Noninvasive Index [MINI] to predict endoscopic healing in Crohn's disease, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] indices that measure inflammation (ie, the Paediatric Inflammatory Crohn's Magnetic Resonance Enterography Index [PICMI]) and perianal disease (ie, Paediatric MRI-based Perianal Crohn's Disease [PEMPAC]), and patient-reported outcome measures in ulcerative colitis [ie, TUMMY-UC], upper gastrointestinal inflammatory score [ie, UGI-SES-CD], simplified endoscopic mucosal assessment score for Crohn's disease [SEMA-CD], and the parent-completed IMPACT questionnaire [ie, IMPACT-III-P].

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central (up to May 2022). Nine randomized clinical trials and four economic evaluations that examined any anti-TNF drugs (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab) against different alternatives were included. In studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-TNF drugs in Crohn's disease, most assessed the efficacy of maintenance regimen in patients who had previously responded to induction (response=28%-63%, and clinical remission=17%-83% depending on dose, drug, and follow-up). In ulcerative colitis, maintenance treatment with anti-TNF drugs reported clinical remission rates between 17% and 44%. Nine studies reported information on adverse events. No clinical trials comparing different anti-TNF drugs were found. The findings from this review suggest that maintenance treatment with anti-TNF drugs (such as infliximab and adalimumab) in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease is probably effective and safe.

Besides, a Western-type diet is associated in epidemiological studies with CD onset and increasing evidence shows that diet can modulate the composition of bile acids and gut microbiota, which in turn modulates the susceptibility of the ileum to inflammation. Thus, the interplay between environmental factors and the histological and anatomical features of the ileum is thought to explain the specific transcriptome profile observed in CD ileitis. Indeed, both immune response and cellular healing processes harbour differences between ileal and non-ileal CD. Taken together, these findings advocate for a dedicated therapeutic approach to managing ileal CD. Currently, interventional pharmacological studies have failed to clearly demonstrate distinct response profiles according to disease site. However, the high rate of stricturing disease in ileal CD requires the identification of new therapeutic targets to significantly change the natural history of this debilitating disease.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37377591/", "Qualifers": ["epidemiology", "genetics", "therapy"]}, {"PMID": "37652654", "Title": "Updates in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel Crohn's disease.", "Abstract": "", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37652654/", "Qualifers": ["diagnosis", "therapy"]}, {"PMID": "37455149", "Title": "Recent advances in the treatment of IBD: Targets, mechanisms and related therapies.", "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as a representative inflammatory disease, currently has multiple effective treatment options available and new therapeutic strategies are being actively explored to further increase the treatment options for patients with IBD.

Since the consumption of oil is essential in the diet, improving IBD through oil has potential. In this article, we first briefly reviewed the current treatment methods for IBD and introduce the role of natural oils in improving inflammatory diseases. We then focused on the recent discovery of the role of natural oils in the prevention and treatment of IBD and summarized their main mechanisms of action. The results showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of oils derived from different plants and animals has been validated in various experimental animal models. These oils are capable of improving the intestinal homeostasis in IBD animal models through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of the gut microbiota, protection of the intestinal barrier, reduction in colonic inflammation, improvement in oxidative stress levels in the intestine, and regulation of immune homeostasis. Therefore, dietary or topical use of natural oils may have potential therapeutic effects on IBD. However, currently, only a few clinical trials support the aforementioned conclusions.

This Commission draws together a wide range of expertise to discuss the current costs of IBD care, the drivers of increasing costs, and how to deliver affordable care for IBD in the future. The key conclusions are that (1) increases in health-care costs must be evaluated against improved disease management and reductions in indirect costs, and (2) that overarching systems for data interoperability, registries, and big data approaches must be established for continuous assessment of effectiveness, costs, and the cost-effectiveness of care.

With the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it became possible to find these variants and corresponding genes, leading so far to the discovery of ca 240 loci associated with IBD. Together, these however explain only 20-25% of the heritability of IBD, leaving a large portion unaccounted for.

Treatment of anal fistulas usually consists of anal surgery; however, results of closure rates are not satisfactory especially with complex perianal fistulas, after which many patients may suffer from anal incontinence. Recently, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has shown promising efficacy. Herein, we aim to explore whether MSCs are effective for complex perianal fistulas and if they have either short-term, medium-term, long-term or over-long-term efficacy.

We searched four online databases and analysed data based on information within the clinical trials registry. The outcomes of eligible trials were analysed with Review Manager 5.4.1. Relative risk and related 95% confidence interval were calculated to compare the effect between the MSCs and control groups. In addition, the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to evaluate the bias risk of eligible studies. Meta-analyses showed that therapy with MSCs was superior to conventional treatment for complex perianal fistulas in short-, long- and over-long-term follow-up phases.

It is caused by altered digestion and absorption within the small bowel, inadequate food intake, and drug-nutrient interactions in patients. Malnutrition is an essential problem because it is related to an increased risk of infections and poor prognosis in patients. It is known that malnutrition is also related to an increased risk of postsurgery complications in IBD patients. Basic nutritional screening involves anthropometric parameters with body mass index (BMI) and others (fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, muscle strength), medical history concerning weight loss, and biochemical parameters (including the Prognostic Nutritional Index). Besides standard nutritional screening tools, including the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Nutritional Risk Score 2002 (NRS 2002), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), specific nutritional screening tools are used in IBD patients, such as the Saskatchewan Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Nutrition Risk Tool (SaskIBD-NR Tool and IBD-specific Nutritional Screening Tool). There is a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies (including iron, zinc, magnesium) and vitamin deficiencies (including folic acid, vitamin B12 and D) in IBD patients. Therefore, regular evaluation of nutritional status is important in IBD patients because many of them are undernourished. An association between plasma ghrelin and leptin and nutritional status in IBD patients has been observed. According to some authors, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF\u03b1) therapy (infliximab) can improve nutritional status in IBD patients. On the other hand, improvement in nutritional status may increase the response rate to infliximab therapy in CD patients. Optimization of nutritional parameters is necessary to improve results of conservative and surgical treatment and to prevent postoperative complications in patients with IBDs.

Polymicrobial interkingdom interactions between bacterial (the bacteriome) and fungal (the mycobiome) communities of the gut have become a prominent focus for development of potential therapeutic approaches. In addition to polymicrobial interactions, the complex gut ecosystem also mediates interactions between the host and the microbiota. These interactions are complex and bidirectional; microbiota composition can be influenced by host immune response, disease-specific therapeutics, antimicrobial drugs, and overall ecosystems. However, the gut microbiota also influences host immune response to a drug or therapy by potentially transforming the drug's structure and altering bioavailability, activity, or toxicity. This is especially true in cases where the gut microbiota has produced a biofilm. The negative ramifications of biofilm formation include alteration of gut permeability, enhanced antimicrobial resistance, and alteration of host immune response effectiveness. Natural modulation of the gut microbiota, using probiotic and prebiotic approaches, may also be used to affect the host microbiome, a type of \"natural\" modulation of the host microbiota composition. In this review, we discuss potential bidirectional interactions between microbes and host, and we describe the changes in gut microbiota induced by probiotic and prebiotic approaches as well as their potential clinical consequences, including biofilm formation. We outline a systematic approach to designing probiotics capable of altering the host microbiota in disease states, using Crohn's disease as a model chronic disease.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a family of small molecules that block one or more of the intracellular tyrosine kinases, including JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3 and TYK-2. Tofacitinib, a non-selective small molecule JAK inhibitor, and\u00a0upadacitinib and filgotinib, which are selective JAK-1 inhibitors, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. Compared to biological drugs, JAK inhibitors have a short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no immunogenicity. Both clinical trials and real-world evidence support the use of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of IBD. However, these therapies have been linked with multiple adverse events (AEs) including infection, hypercholesterolemia, venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and malignancy. While early studies recognized several potential AEs, post-marketing trials have shown that tofacitinib may increase the risk of thromboembolic diseases and major cardiovascular events. The latter are seen in patients aged 50 years or older with cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the\u00a0benefits of treatment and risk stratification need to be considered when positioning tofacitinib.

A plethora of studies has revealed that inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines are associated with altered expression and activity of various proteins such as those involved in drug metabolism, specifically cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Emphasis of most available reports is on the inflammation-induced downregulation of CYPs, subsequently an increase in their substrate concentrations, and the link between the condition and the inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, reports also suggest that inflammation influences expression and/or activity of other proteins such as those involved in the drug-receptor interaction. These multifaced involvements render the clinical consequence of the inflammation unexpected. Such changes are shown in many inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, acute respiratory illnesses as well as natural processes such as aging, among others. For example, some commonly used cardiovascular drugs lose their efficacy when patients get afflicted with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Interestingly, this is despite increased concentration subsequent to reduced clearance. The observation is attributed to a simultaneous reduction in the expression of target receptor proteins such as the calcium and potassium channel and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor as well as the metabolic enzymes.

Although the percentage of pediatric IBD patients seems to be increasing, rates are surprisingly heterogeneous among different populations. Although the pathogenesis of IBD is believed to be multifactorial, a genetic predisposition may be especially relevant in pediatric-onset IBD. Phenotypic characteristics can also be significantly different when comparing pediatric and adult-onset IBD. Patients that develop the disease at a younger age usually present with more extensive and more aggressive disease and develop complications faster when compared to those that develop it during adulthood. Children with IBD are found to have frequent mood disorders and have a higher risk of developing socio-economic hardship, failing to meet development milestones. Therefore, IBD management should always involve a multidisciplinary team that is not limited to medical providers. Most institutions do not have an established transition protocol and lack the resources and training for transition care. Although there is no consensus on an optimal timing to transition the patient's care to an adult team, it is usually accepted they should be eligible for adult care when most of the key transition points have been met. Management strategies should be tailored to each patient's developmental level and environment.

Recent studies have revealed that NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles can play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and sustaining the intestinal immune response in IBD. On the one hand, aberrant activation of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles may cause excessive immune response by converting caspase-1, proIL-18, and proIL-1\u03b2 to their active forms and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines to stimulate the development and progression of IBD, and we can improve IBD by targeting blockade of NLRP3 activation.

Organoid 3D culture systems offer a unique model for dissecting epithelial mechanisms involved IBDs and testing individualized therapy, although the lack of a functional immune system and a microbiota, two driving components of the IBD pathogenesis, represent a major barrier to their exploitation in clinical medicine. In this review, we have examined how to improve the translational utility of intestinal organoids in IBD and how co-cultures of 3D or 2D organoids and immune cells and/or intestinal microbiota might help to overcome these limitations.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Review", "Journal Article"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36411558/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "36366802", "Title": "Clinical Impact of Endoscopic Evaluation of the Small Bowel in Crohn's Disease.", "Abstract": "The STRIDE-II position statement has established endoscopic healing as the long-term target of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and ileocolonoscopy is considered the gold standard for assessment of endoscopic healing.

Further, IBD incidence is rising sharply in Asia and other recently developed and developing countries. In this review, we discuss the implications of changing trends of IBD epidemiology. First, changing patterns provide insights into IBD causes, as they occur concurrent with shifts in the environment, cultures, and attitudes. Understanding the impact of the environment on IBD risk can help towards prediction and prevention strategies. Second, we must prepare healthcare systems for the rising burden of IBD and address it at various levels towards improving outcomes and health, overall.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Journal
