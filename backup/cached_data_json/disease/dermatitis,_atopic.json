Clinically, patients experience intense pruritus, erythema, and scaling, which can lead to secondary infections due to scratching.

While AD itself is not an allergic reaction and does not necessarily involve allergen sensitization, AD patients show higher rates of sensitization to food and inhalant allergens compared to the general population. Recent evidence refining the \"dual allergen exposure hypothesis\" demonstrates that early oral exposure to allergens through an intact gastrointestinal barrier typically promotes tolerance, while exposure through compromised skin or respiratory barriers often leads to sensitization. Therefore, the impaired skin barrier function in AD patients increases the risk of transcutaneous sensitization and may interfere with oral tolerance development. Interestingly, AD patients' sensitivity to contact allergens (such as metals and fragrances) is not necessarily higher than that of the general population, which may be related to the inherent properties of these allergens. Personalized allergen testing can help guide appropriate allergen avoidance and reintroduction strategies in AD management. The insights into optimal allergen exposure conditions have also expanded the potential applications of allergen-specific immunotherapy in preventing AD onset in high-risk populations and halting the atopic march.", "Year": "2025", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39924626/", "Qualifers": ["immunology", "etiology", "epidemiology"]}, {"PMID": "39895627", "Title": "Skin microbiome and dermatologic disorders.", "Abstract": "Human skin acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of pathogenic microbes while simultaneously providing a home for commensal bacteria and fungi.

In HS, psoriasis, and AD, we found that itch often co-localized with pain and occurred more frequently at night. Furthermore, itch was found to negatively affect sleep and increase the risk for comorbid psychiatric disorders in HS, psoriasis, and AD. However, HS-, psoriasis-, and AD-related itch differ in temporality. Itch in AD is often described as chronic, while itch in HS and psoriasis is often described as episodic. HS-associated itch is likely multifactorial, and several mechanisms have been proposed including peripheral sensitization, central sensitization, and neuroinflammation. Prior studies in HS highlight enhanced IgE production and a dense infiltration of mast cells, along with a variety of cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, alterations in the skin microbiome may contribute to itch in HS. To date, few therapies have been studied to treat itch in HS.

As APCs, LCs recruit other immune cells and shape the immune response, especially adaptive immunity via polarization of T cells. As sentinel cells, LCs are primary sensors of the skin microbiome and are important for the decision of immunity versus tolerance. LCs are also involved with the integrity of the skin barrier by influencing tight junctions. Finally, LCs are important cells in the neuro-immune crosstalk in the skin.

Due to the high burden of dermatological signs and symptoms, atopic dermatitis has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. In the absence of objective measures to accurately assess severity and symptom burden, patient-reported outcome measures are essential to monitor the impact and progression of the disease, as well as the efficacy of treatments. Although there are currently no standardised guidelines for their use in clinical practice, there are some initiatives, such as the Harmonise Outcome Measures for Eczema and Vivir con Dermatitis At\u00f3pica, that can provide guidance. As healthcare systems move towards value-based healthcare models, patient-reported measures are becoming increasingly important for incorporating the patient perspective and improving the quality of healthcare services. The use of these measures can help monitor disease activity and guide treatment decisions. This article discusses the impact of atopic dermatitis and describes the patient-reported outcome measures commonly used in atopic dermatitis and the recommendations of the initiatives that have selected a core set of measures to best assess atopic dermatitis in clinical practice. Considering the recommendations of these initiatives and based on our experience in clinical practice, we propose the use of the Dermatology Life Quality Index to assess the impact of the disease on quality of life, the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure to assess symptom severity, and the Numerical Rating Scale or the Visual Analogue Scale to measure itch intensity.

The second case describes a 14-year-old female who experienced depigmentation on her forehead one month into dupilumab treatment, with partial improvement of vitiligo lesions over time despite continued therapy. This phenomenon may be due to dupilumab blocking type 2 inflammation, disrupting normal skin homeostasis, and exacerbating type 1 inflammation. These cases, supplemented with a literature review, highlight the potential for biologic drug-induced vitiligo and underscore the need for awareness of such adverse events in clinical practice.

New therapies, including the monoclonal antibody therapy dupilumab, offer excellent efficacy. However, in clinical trials, and emphasized in real-world observations, an unexpected increased frequency of ocular adverse effects has become apparent. The effectiveness of dupilumab and the unpredictability of ocular adverse effects mean that clinicians need guidance on counselling patients prior to treatment and on managing them if adverse effects arise. The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) and Royal College of Ophthalmologists collaborated on this consensus guidance on managing dupilumab-related ocular surface disorders (DROSD). A multidisciplinary group was formed of adult and paediatric dermatologists and ophthalmologists with expertise in DROSD, patient representatives and the BAD Clinical Standards Unit. A literature search was conducted and the results reviewed. All recommendations were reviewed, discussed and voted on. The recommendations pertain to dermatology and ophthalmology management, and apply to people of all ages, unless otherwise stated. Importantly, initiation of dupilumab for AD should not be delayed for most eye disorders except acute new problems (e.g. infections) or potentially severe conditions (e.g. a history of corneal transplant; ophthalmology advice should be sought first). There is insufficient evidence to recommend lubricant drops prophylactically. Dermatologists should assess eye complaints to diagnose DROSD; a severity grading system is provided. DROSD management differs slightly in those aged < 7\u2005years, as ocular complications may affect neuro-ocular development. Therefore, irrespectively of DROSD severity, this population should be referred for ophthalmology advice. In those aged \u2265 7\u2005years, dermatologists should feel confident to trial treatment and reserve ophthalmology advice for severe or nonresponding cases. Discussion about dupilumab withdrawal should be prompted by a significant impact on quality of life, threat to sight, or other complications. Although dupilumab is a highly effective agent for treating AD, the risk of ocular adverse effects should not inhibit clinicians or patients from using it, but clinicians should be aware of them. If a patient develops DROSD, there are clear pathways to assess severity and offer initial management. Where this is ineffective, dermatologists should assess the urgency and seek advice from or initiate referral to ophthalmology.

Tralokinumab and lebrikizumab are selective IL-13 inhibitors that have demonstrated safety and efficacy as treatment options for AD in phase III trials. Tralokinumab is approved for use in Europe and the USA, while lebrikizumab is approved only in Europe. Cendakimab, which is another IL-13 selective inhibitor, has shown promising results in phase II trials, providing safe and effective outcomes. Eblasakimab, which disrupts IL-13 and IL-4 signaling pathways, is currently in phase II trials following well-tolerated administration in phase I studies. This narrative review aims to outline the current state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness and safety of these four biologic agents targeting IL-13 signaling.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39558725/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy", "immunology"]}, {"PMID": "39454315", "Title": "Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides: A promising therapeutic strategy for inflammatory skin disorders.", "Abstract": "Chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) impose a significant burden on both the skin and the overall well-being of individuals, leading to a diminished quality of life. Despite the use of conventional treatments like topical steroids, there remains a need for more effective and safer therapeutic options to improve the lives of patients with severe skin conditions. Molecular therapy has emerged as a promising approach to address disorders such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact hypersensitivity. One strategy to counteract the disease processes involves targeting the transcriptional process. A novel form of gene therapy utilizes double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), also known as decoys, that contain cis-elements. By introducing these decoy ODNs through transfection, the cis-trans interactions are disrupted, leading to the inhibition of trans-factors from binding to the intrinsic cis-elements and thus regulating gene expression. In this review, we have summarized studies investigating the therapeutic effects of decoy ODNs on inflammatory skin diseases. Various transcription factors, including NF-kB, STAT6, HIF-1\u03b1/STAT5, STAT1, and Smad, have been targeted and inhibited using designed decoy ODNs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, hypertrophic scarring, and contact hypersensitivity.

Although the pathogenesis of the disease are unclear, epidermal barrier dysfunction, immune and microbial dysregulation, and environmental factors are known to be critical etiologies in AD pathology. The skin microbiota represents an ecosystem consisting of numerous microbial species that interact with each other as well as host epithelial cells and immune cells. Although the skin microbiota benefits the host by supporting the basic functions of the skin and preventing the colonization of pathogens, disruption of the microbial balance (dysbiosis) can cause skin diseases such as AD. Although AD is a dermatological disease, recent evidence has shown that changes in microbiota composition in the skin and intestine contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Environmental factors that contribute to skin barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis in AD include allergens, diet, irritants, air pollution, epigenetics and microbial exposure. Knowing the microbial combination of intestin, as well as the genetic and epigenetic determinants associated with the development of autoantibodies, may help elucidate the pathophysiology of the disease. The skin of patients with AD is characterized by microbial dysbiosis as a result of reduced microbial diversity and overgrowth of the pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Recent studies have revealed the importance of building a strong immune response against microorganisms during childhood and new mechanisms of microbial community dynamics in modulating the skin microbiome. Numerous microorganisms are reported to modulate host response through communication with keratinocytes, specific immune cells and adipocytes to improve skin health and barrier function. This growing insight into bioactive substances in the skin microbiota has led to novel biotherapeutic approaches targeting the skin surface for the treatment of AD. This review will provide an updated overview of the skin microbiota in AD and its complex interaction with immune response mechanisms, as well as explore possible underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AD and provide insights into new therapeutic developments for the treatment of AD.

OX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 are costimulatory immune checkpoint molecules that regulate effector and memory T-cell activity and promote sustained immune responses in multiple immunological pathways, including T helper (Th)2, Th1, Th17 and Th22. As such, OX40L/OX40 signalling between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activated T cells postantigen recognition promotes pathogenic T-cell proliferation and survival. Under inflammatory conditions, OX40L is upregulated on APCs, enhancing the magnitude of antigen-specific T-cell responses and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In AD, OX40L/OX40 signalling contributes to the amplification and chronic persistence of T-cell-mediated inflammation. Recent therapeutic success in clinical trials has highlighted the importance of the OX40L/OX40 axis as a promising target for the treatment of AD.

In infants and children, loss-of-function mutations in skin barrier genes associate with food allergy. In a mouse model with skin barrier mutations (Flakey Tail, FT+/- mice), topical epicutaneous sensitization to a food allergen peanut extract (PNE), an environmental allergen Alternaria alternata (Alt) and a detergent induce food allergy and then an oral PNE-challenge induces anaphylaxis. Exposures to these allergens and detergents can occur for infants and children in a household setting. From the clinical and preclinical studies of neonates and children with skin barrier mutations, early oral exposure to allergenic foods before skin sensitization may induce tolerance to food allergens and thus protect against development of food allergy. In the FT+/- mice, oral food allergen prior to skin sensitization induce tolerance to food allergens. However, when the skin of FT+/- pups are exposed to a ubiquitous environmental allergen at the time of oral consumption of food allergens, this blocks the induction of tolerance to the food allergen and the mice can then be skin sensitized with the food allergen. The development of food allergy in neonatal FT+/- mice is mediated by altered skin responses to allergens with increases in skin expression of interleukin 33, oncostatin M and amphiregulin. The development of neonate food allergy is enhanced when born to an allergic mother, but it is inhibited by maternal supplementation with \u03b1-tocopherol. Moreover, preclinical studies suggest that food allergen skin sensitization can occur before manifestation of clinical features of atopic dermatitis.

The dual allergen exposure hypothesis posits that sensitization to food allergens may occur with cutaneous exposure on inflamed skin, eg, atopic dermatitis, but early oral consumption generally leads to tolerance. However, only one-third of children with atopic dermatitis develop a food allergy, suggesting that there is a more complex mechanism for allergen sensitization. Emerging evidence suggests that the outcome of cutaneous allergen exposure is context-dependent and largely influenced by the state of the skin barrier with healthy skin promoting natural tolerance. Current research supports the ability to induce desensitization through repeated application of allergens to the skin, known as epicutaneous immunotherapy. Preclinical research with an occlusive patch has demonstrated a significantly reduced T-helper cell type 2-driven immunologic response when applied to intact, uninflamed skin and induction of a unique population of regulatory T cells that express a broader range of homing receptors, which may be able to maintain sustained protection. In clinical studies of children aged 1 through 11 years with a peanut allergy, epicutaneous immunotherapy with an occlusive patch led to significant desensitization with no major differences in efficacy or safety between children with and without atopic dermatitis.

In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunologic, and microbial components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with Staphylococcus aureus. The secretion of virulence factors, such as toxins and proteases, by S aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and additionally disrupts the balance of an already skewed immune response. Skin commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S aureus through quorum sensing. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the skin pH; UV treatment; and use of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Furthermore, exploratory techniques such as skin microbiome transplantation, ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed.

Its clinical management poses challenges due to the absence of a definitive cure, and its prevalence varies across ethnicities, genders, and geographic locations. The epigenetic landscape of AD includes changes in DNA methylation, changes in histone acetylation and methylation, and regulation by non-coding RNAs. These changes affect inflammatory and immune mechanisms, and research has identified AD-specific variations in DNA methylation, particularly in the affected epidermis. Histone modifications, including acetylation, have been associated with the disruption of skin barrier function in AD, suggesting the potential therapeutic benefit of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as belinostat. Furthermore, non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been implicated in modulating various cellular processes central to AD pathogenesis. Therapeutic implications in AD include the potential use of DNA methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors to correct aberrant methylation patterns and modulate gene expression related to immune responses and skin barrier functions. Additionally, the emerging role of lncRNAs suggests the possibility of using small interfering RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit lncRNAs and adjust their regulatory impact on gene expression.

Current evidence implicates fungi, particularly Malassezia spp., in the pathogenesis of HND. Penetration of fungal antigens through the defective AD skin barrier activates the innate and adaptive immune systems to cause cutaneous inflammation via the T helper (Th)17 and/or Th2 axes. Malassezia sensitization may distinguish HND from other forms of AD.

Its etiology is multifactorial and, among the predisposing factors, a role is played by oxidative stress. Pollution, recurrent infections, and psychological stress contribute to oxidative stress, amplifying the production of proinflammatory cytokines and worsening barrier damage. There are various oxidative stress mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, AD often appears to be associated with psychological disorders such as alexithymia, depression, and anxiety due to severe itching and related insomnia, as well as social distress and isolation. The increasing incidence of AD requires the evaluation of additional therapeutic approaches in order to reduce the psychological burden of this condition. Our review aims to evaluate the role of some nutraceuticals in AD treatment and its related psychological comorbidities. The combination of some natural compounds (flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenes, isothiocyanates) with traditional AD treatments might be useful in improving the effectiveness of therapy, by reducing chronic inflammation and preventing flare-ups, and in promoting corticosteroid sparing. In addition, some of these nutraceuticals also appear to have a role in the treatment of psychological disorders, although the underlying oxidative stress mechanisms are different from those already known for AD.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732239/", "Qualifers": ["therapy", "psychology"]}, {"PMID": "38753434", "Title": "Proteomic alterations in patients with atopic dermatitis.", "Abstract": "Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease with a complex and multifactorial pathogenesis.

Patients considered that physical function was the most strongly affected domain, followed by sleep quality and emotional well-being, establishing that a minimum pruritus intensity of 4 and 7 points impacts moderately and severely, respectively, on the different domains of patients' health- related quality of life.

Skin microbiota imbalance is known in several skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, acne and hidradenitis suppurative (HS). Such microbiota dysregulation is usually correlated with inflammation, discomfort and pruritus. Although conventional treatments, that is, the administration of steroids and antibiotics, have shown some efficacy in treating and alleviating these symptoms, there are still disadvantages that need to be overcome. These include their long-term usage with side effects negatively impacting resident microbiota members, antibiotic resistance and the elevated rate of recurrence.

Due to the increased rates of ocular surface disease (OSD) reported during treatment with these new targeted treatments, more insight into the occurrence and pathomechanism of OSD in moderate-to-severe AD patients is needed. Therefore, this review's first part highlights that most patients with moderate-to-severe AD already have characteristics of OSD before starting targeted treatment. Remarkably, not all AD patients with OSD report ocular symptoms. OSD in AD is associated with less conjunctival goblet cells (GC) compared to healthy controls. In addition, OSD severity in AD patients is associated with high AD activity, the presence of eyelid and/or facial eczema, and high levels of AD-related severity biomarkers in tear fluid. The second part of this review highlights that pre-existing ocular pathology (e.g. in combination with the use of ophthalmic medication or eyelid eczema) may be associated with the development of dupilumab-associated ocular surface disease (DAOSD). During dupilumab treatment, DAOSD (which can be new-onset OSD or worsening of pre-existing OSD) is observed in approximately one-third of the dupilumab-treated AD patients. Anti-inflammatory ophthalmic treatment improves DAOSD, and dose reduction of dupilumab may also be an effective treatment option. The pathomechanism of DAOSD is still not fully elucidated.

However, the Mucin 5\u2009AC (MUC5AC) expression of GCs decreased during dupilumab treatment, suggesting an impairment of the GC function by dupilumab treatment. In addition, higher dupilumab tear fluid levels were found in dupilumab-treated AD patients with moderate-to-severe OSD compared to patients with no or mild OSD, whereas the dupilumab serum levels are similar.

Pruritus is a clinical hallmark of the disease, and patients with AD often experience disruptions to their quality of life. The pathogenesis of AD is a complex and multifactorial interplay between genetic factors, epidermal barrier disruption, and immune dysregulation. Clinically, AD is characterized by pruritus, eczematous skin changes, and age-specific lesion distribution patterns. Infants and young children tend to have AD lesions on their face and extensor surfaces of their extremities while older children and adults tend to have AD lesions on flexural surfaces of their extremities. Many patients also experience a chronic and relapsing disease course. Due to the chronicity and severe pruritus, lesions often undergo secondary changes like lichenification. Patients with AD can experience a number of comorbidities including other atopic disease (i.e. allergic rhinitis, asthma), skin infections, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Management of AD depends on the severity of the disease as well as the distribution of the disease. Traditionally, treatment of AD included the use of moisturizers / emollients, topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, or systemic therapy with non-selective immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, or similar. However, in the past decade, new biologic and small molecule drugs, both topical and systemic, have become important therapeutic options for AD patients, especially for those with moderate-to-severe disease.

Microbiome dysbiosis, defined by changed diversity and composition, as well as the development of pathobionts, has been identified as a potential cause for recurring episodes of atopic dermatitis. Gut dysbiosis causes \"leaky gut syndrome\" by disrupting the epithelial lining of the gut, which allows bacteria and other endotoxins to enter the bloodstream and cause inflammation.

This review summarizes the current understanding of the similarities and differences in the peripheral mechanisms underlying itch and pain in AD. These distinct yet reciprocal sensations share many similarities in the peripheral nervous system, including common mediators (such as serotonin, endothelin-1, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin), receptors (such as members of the G protein-coupled receptor family and Toll-like receptors), and ion channels for signal transduction (such as certain members of the transient receptor potential [TRP] cation channels). Itch-responding neurons are also sensitive to pain stimuli. However, there are distinct differences between itch and pain signaling. For example, specific immune responses are associated with pain (type 1 and/or type 3 cytokines and certain chemokine C-C [CCL2, CCL5] and C-X-C [CXCL] motif ligands) and itch (type 2 cytokines, including IL-31, and periostin). The TRP melastatin channels TRPM2 and TRPM3 have a role in pain but no known role in itch. Activation of \u03bc-opioid receptors is known to alleviate pain but exacerbate itch.

Onset typically occurs early in life, and although cardinal disease features are similar across all ages, different age groups and ethnicities present distinct clinical characteristics. The disease imposes a significant burden in all health-related quality of life domains, both in children and adults, and a substantial economic cost both at individual and national levels. The pathophysiology of AD includes a complex and multifaceted interplay between the impaired dysfunctional epidermal barrier, genetic predisposition, and environmental contributors, such as chemical and/or biological pollutants and allergens, in the context of dysregulated TH2 and TH17 skewed immune response. Regarding the genetic component, the loss of function mutations encoding structural proteins such as filaggrin, a fundamental epidermal protein, and the more recently identified variations in the epidermal differentiation complex are well-established determinants resulting in an impaired skin barrier in AD. More recently, epigenetic factors have facilitated AD development, including the dysbiotic skin microbiome and the effect of the external exposome, combined with dietary disorders. Notably, the interleukin (IL)-31 network, comprising several cell types, including macrophages, basophils, and the generated cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of itch in AD, has recently been explored.

One critical component in the pathophysiology of AD is the epidermal skin barrier, with its outermost layer, the stratum corneum (SC), conferring biochemical properties that enable resilience against environmental threats and maintain homeostasis. The skin barrier may be conceptualized as a key facilitator of complex interactions between genetics, host immunity, the cutaneous microbiome, and environmental exposures. The key genetic risk factor for AD development and persistence is a loss-of-function mutation in FLG, with recent advances in genomics focusing on rare variant discovery, establishment of pathogenic mechanisms, and exploration of the role of other epidermal differentiation complex gene variants in AD. Aberrant type 2 inflammatory responses down-regulate the transcription of key epidermal barrier genes, alter the composition of SC lipids, and induce further injury through a neurocutaneous feedback loop and the itch-scratch cycle. The dysbiotic epidermis exhibits reduced bacterial diversity and enhanced colonization with Staphylococcus and Malassezia species, which contribute to both direct barrier injury through the action of bacterial toxins and perpetuation of the inflammatory cascades. Enhanced understanding of each of the pathogenic mechanisms underpinning barrier disruption has led to the development of novel topical and systemic molecules, including interleukin (IL)-4Ra, IL-13, PDE4, and Janus-associated kinase inhibitors, whose clinical effectiveness exceeds conventional treatment modalities.

Over the last 5 years, the armamentarium for the treatment of this disease, with both topical and systemic drugs, has increased. Treat-to-target is basically the concept where a treatment goal and a time frame for that goal is set at initiation of a new treatment, and if the goals are not achieved in time, treatment will be adjusted. In clinical trials, treatment targets are based on scoring systems for disease severity as recommended by the Harmonizing Outcome Measure for Eczema (HOME) initiative, with the primary endpoint being a reduction of at least 75% of the baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score (EASI-75). The question, however, is if these are useful targets in real-world settings and how this should be implemented in everyday clinical practice. In rheumatology, setting a measurable target and a time frame for an instigated therapy has been shown to lead to more efficient and successful treatment. For atopic dermatitis, the instruments recommended by HOME form the core outcome measures for the treat-to-target frameworks published to date, which are based on expert consensus and Delphi processes. Although atopic dermatitis patients have a high risk of co-morbidities, including physical, psychological and socioeconomic, instruments to measure the severity of co-morbidities have not been included in these existing frameworks. In order to apply a treat-to-target strategy that is meaningful for both the patient and the doctor, validated tools for the measurement of treatment effect on co-morbidities exist and should be included in a shared decision-making process with the individual patient when choosing which targets to aim for and what should be considered treatment success. An obvious limitation for the implementation of a treat-to-target strategy in the clinical setting with atopic dermatitis is that retrieving the data needed is very time consuming.

The pathology behind atopic dermatitis etiology is loss of epidermal barrier, which prevents the production of protein filaggrin that can induce T-cell infiltration and inflammation. Treatment of AD is majorly based on limiting skin repair as well as reducing inflammation and itching. There are several remedies available for the treatment of AD, such as Janus kinase and calcineurin inhibitors, topical corticosteroids, and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. The conventional formulations in the market have limited safety and efficacy. Hence, effective treatment of atopic dermatitis requires the development of novel, efficacious, reliable, and specific therapies. Recent research data have revealed that some naturally occurring medicinal plants have potential applications in the management of AD through different mechanisms. The nanotechnology-based therapeutics have gained a lot of attention in the last decade for the improvement in the activity of drugs having low absorption due to poor solubility, thus leading to lesser bioavailability. Therapies based on nanotechnology can be an effective way to overcome these obstacles. Due to their effective propensity to provide better drug diffusion and bioavailability as well as drug targeting potential at the desired site of action, these approaches may have decreased adverse drug effects, better penetration, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

In fact, the new indications seem to point out the harmful effect of elimination diets, except in rare cases, the uselessness of chrono-insertions during complementary feeding and some benefits, albeit weak, of breastfeeding in those at greater risk. In this context, metabolomics and lipidomics can be necessary for a more in-depth knowledge of the complex metabolic network underlying this pathology. In fact, an alteration of the metabolic contents in children with AD has been highlighted, especially in correlation to the intestinal microbiota. While preliminary lipidomic studies showed the usefulness of a more in-depth knowledge of the alterations of the skin barrier to improve the development of baby skin care products.

Food allergy reactions, in turn, can be mediated by immediate hypersensitivity mechanisms, delayed hypersensitivity or mixed immediate-delayed mechanisms. The reference diagnostic method in food allergy is the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge test (DBPCFC), but skin and serological tests are important in the clinical context. The diagnosis of immediate food allergy depends on well-standardized allergological tests, such as the skin prick test (SPT) or specific IgE dosing, which are ideally tested by food challenge testing. However, the diagnosis of delayed mechanism food allergy and mixed allergies, which combine both immune mechanisms, is more complex. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are evaluated with the epicutaneous patch test, or patch testing, for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. The atopy patch test is initially used for the investigation of inflammatory reactions, which may be linked to food allergens in patients with atopic dermatitis. It was later applied in other diseases, whose pathogenesis is mainly mediated by a mechanism of delayed hypersensitivity to protein allergens: eosinophilic esophagitis, enterocolitis induced by food proteins, protein contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, among other disorders.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38506867/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "38203432", "Title": "How Do Classical Subtypes Correspond to Endotypes in Atopic Dermatitis?", "Abstract": "Since atopic dermatitis (AD) is a heterogeneous condition, the subtyping of AD is a crucial issue.

While the subtyping of AD was historically conducted based on the phenotype, recent findings on the mechanisms of AD have revealed the importance of the endotype, which can characterize individual patients more accurately. Considering the current development of AD therapies, AD endotyping is a prerequisite for a personalized therapeutic choice. Endotypes of AD can be stratified from different viewpoints, including cytokine expression patterns, allergen properties, epidermal barrier conditions, ceramide variation, the involvement of innate immunity, and serum biomarkers.

Consequently, IL-37 is linked to IL-18, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), consistent with our studies. Some isoforms of IL-37 are expressed by keratinocytes, monocytes, and other skin immune cells.

He was also active in the famous Saint-Louis hospital in Paris. Academician Kogoj's scientific interests were especially focused on allergies, exanthemas, skin tuberculosis, and keratodermas. Kogoj was very active in defining a precise and useful terminology for various dermatological conditions, where the terminology was in many ways confusing and often overlapping, such as in cases of eczema and dermatitis. Kogoj performed experimental studies of allergic reactions in eczema and atopic dermatitis and introduced the term pruridermatitis (Pruridermatitis allergica chronica) into dermatological terminology instead of the name neurodermitis and other synonyms essentially describing atopic dermatitis (endogenous eczema, prurigo-asthma, prurigo Besnier). Academician Kogoj managed to define Mal de Meleda as a separate form of hereditary keratoderma and was engaged in the clinical symptomatology, serology, and therapy of syphilis, whereby he emphasized the so-called \"critical moment\" in the treatment of syphilis. Academician Kogoj's most famous scientific achievement was his histological definition of the spongiform pustule in the pathomorphology of psoriasis, which became a groundbreaking histological novelty in the classification of psoriasis, thus bearing Kogoj's name in the medical literature to this date.

The therapeutic potential of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) has garnered significant interest in recent years. AD is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by impaired epidermal barrier function and immune function imbalance, and its pathogenesis is closely associated with dysregulated JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways.

A number of non-steroidal topicals for treatment of inflammatory dermatoses have been developed in the recent decades, such as topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream), vitamin D analogues, and phophodiesterase-4 inhibitors (crisaborole), but none had the combination of broad therapeutic range, relatively rapid onset of action, tolerability, and wide-spread clinical success that allowed topical glucocorticosteroids to remain the mainstay of therapy. This situation has shifted dramatically with three non-steroidal new molecular entities, each with completely different mechanisms of action, receiving approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past year. Topical ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was the first to receive FDA approval, specifically for treating atopic dermatitis, and was the subject of the first report in this series. Subsequently, topical tapinarof, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent, was approved by the FDA for treating plaque psoriasis in May 2022 and was the focus of the second report in this series.

Recent studies have shown that IL-33, which triggers inflammation, and IL-37, which suppresses it, cooperatively regulate the balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation. IL-33 and IL-37 are also deeply involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. Furthermore, a signaling pathway by which aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor for dioxins, regulates the expression of IL-33 and IL-37 has been revealed. Here, we outline recent findings on the mechanisms regulating IL-33 and IL-37 expression in AD and psoriasis. IL-33 expression is partially dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and IL-37 has a role in suppressing MAPK in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-33 downregulates skin barrier function proteins including filaggrin and loricrin, thereby downregulating the expression of IL-37, which colocalizes with these proteins. This leads to an imbalance of the IL-33-IL-37 axis, involving increased IL-33 and decreased IL-37, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of AD and psoriasis.

It has severe quality of life ramifications in those that struggle with it, including days missed from work or school, productivity loss and impaired work functioning. For years, the standard of care included topical moisturizing creams, topical steroids and more recently systemic agents. As new therapeutic targets emerge and recent advances are being developed, it is now more possible than ever that hand eczema can be managed via the underlying mechanisms. A review of the literature was conducted to identify current treatment options for hand eczema and chronic hand eczema. The terms 'hand eczema', 'hand dermatitis' were used to search PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase. To identify new therapies still undergoing investigation, we used the terms 'hand eczema', 'hand dermatitis', 'atopic dermatitis', and 'vesicular eczema of hands and/or feet' to search Clinicaltrials.gov for all studies until December 2022. There were 56 ongoing clinical trials identified for pharmacological treatments for hand eczema on Clinicaltrials.gov from 2000 - 2022, with 16 that are new or ongoing. These included studies for dupilumab, ruxolitinib, delgocitinib (LEO124249), gusacitinib (ASN002), AFX 5931, and roflumilast (ARQ-252). Two major classes of drugs emerging for the treatment of hand eczema include IL-4/IL-13 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors.

In this narrative review, we discuss key terminology as it relates to AD across shades of skin, including modern definitions of 'race', 'ethnicity', and 'SOC'. We then synthesize the current literature describing disparities in AD prevalence, disease recognition, and burden alongside current data regarding genetic and immunologic findings across SOC populations. In the context of these findings, we highlight key concomitant social determinants of health, including environmental factors, socioeconomic status, and access to care, for which race often serves as a proxy for true biological and genetic differences.

In the past few decades, increasing knowledge on the AD pathogenesis has driven the development of novel targeted therapies. Interleukin (IL)-13 plays a central and pleiotropic role in AD pathogenesis, contributing directly or indirectly to epidermal barrier disfunction, type-2 inflammation, dysbiosis, fibrosis, and itch response. For this reason, agents selectively targeting IL-13, such as lebrikizumab, emerged as a potential therapy for AD. This article reviews the current evidence about lebrikizumab in the management of AD. The phase II and phase III trials seem to corroborate efficacy of lebrikizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, as shown by significant improvement of Eczema Area and Severity Index, body surface area, and pruritus scores. Also, lebrikizumab demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability profiles, with the majority of patients experiencing no significant adverse events.

This, in conjunction with AD's rising prevalence, made the development of alternative treatment strategies the focus of both the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry.

For atopic dermatitis, no NB-UVB studies utilized EASI 75 as their outcome measure, hindering the ability to directly compare cost effectiveness for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. However, all NB-UVB studies depicted a reduced treatment cost per treatment period compared to studies assessing biologics, although this comparison does not account for efficacy. The results depict NB-UVB to be the most cost effective for the treatment of psoriasis and the least expensive per treatment period for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. However, certain factors need to be taken into account. Biologics may be more effective for more severe disease, do not require multiple weekly clinic visits, and the ease for patient compliance may lead some to favor biologic therapy.

The impact of ambient air pollutants including particulate matter (PM) and AD pruritic exacerbation has been recorded despite reductions in air pollution levels in in developed countries. The developing countries have, on the contrary, experienced significant urbanization and industrialization with limited environmental protection standards in the past decades. This unprecedented construction, petrochemical industry utilization, and increment in population counts has been paired with consistent exposure to outdoor PM. This may present a key cause of AD pruritic exacerbation supported by the fact that AD prevalence has intensified globally in the past 50 years, indicating that environmental exposure may act as a trigger that could flare up itch in vulnerable persons. At the molecular level, the impact of PM on severe pruritus in AD could be interpreted by the toxic effects on the complex neuroimmune pathways that govern this disease.

In particular, we were able to identify a number of specific bacterial and fungal species/genera in the intestine that were repeatedly associated in the literature with either increased or decreased allergic diseases of the skin, like atopic dermatitis, or the airways, like allergic rhinitis and asthma. The reported studies indicate that in addition to the composition of the microbiome, also the relative abundance of certain microbial species and the overall diversity are associated with allergic diseases of the corresponding organs. As anticipated for human association studies, the underlying mechanisms of the organ-organ crosstalk could not be clearly resolved yet.

The skin of patients with AD is frequently over-colonized by biofilm-growing Staphylococcus aureus, especially during flares, causing dysbiosis of the cutaneous microbiota and a decrease in bacterial diversity that inversely correlates with AD severity. Specific changes in the skin microbiome can be present before clinical AD onset in infancy. Additionally, local skin anatomy, lipid content, pH, water activity and sebum secretion differ between children and adults and generally correlate with the predominant microbiota. Considering the importance of S.\u2009aureus in AD, treatments aimed at reducing over-colonization to rebalance microbial diversity may help manage AD and reduce flares. Anti-staphylococcal interventions in AD will contribute to a decrease in S.\u2009aureus superantigens and proteases that cause damage and inflammation of the skin barrier while concomitantly increasing the proportion of commensal bacteria that secrete antimicrobial molecules that protect healthy skin from invading pathogens.

There is increasing evidence that AD has higher prevalence, persistence, and severity among skin of color populations. This is likely to be partly related to differences in living conditions and exposure to irritants and allergens, among other factors. Assessment of AD severity in patients with darker skin can be challenging, in particular the assessment of erythema, leading to the potential for underscoring AD severity. Variations in disease have also been described, with the potential for a greater risk of inflammation-induced nodularity and hyper- or hypopigmentation. Management challenges include variable adherence to treatment, potential disparities in access to health care, and differences in the metabolism of cyclosporine. Optimal management of AD in patients with skin of color requires a tailored approach.

The objective of this review is to characterize the difference in efficacy and adverse effects between TCS and TCI. A review of the literature between 2002 and 2022 was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Ten studies comparing TCS of varying potencies with TCI approved for AD treatment were included in the review. Outcome measures were qualified using percent reductions on the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index score and decreases in physician's global evaluation of AD severity. Tacrolimus had statistically significant (P < .05) improvement in disease severity compared with TCS in 4 of the 5 studies that compared tacrolimus with weak TCS. The data suggest greater treatment efficacy of tacrolimus over weak TCS, and inferior efficacy of pimecrolimus (TCI) compared with both tacrolimus and weak TCS. It is difficult to draw conclusions between moderate, potent, and very potent TCS and TCI due to the small number of available studies. TCI can improve disease severity, especially on thin or intertriginous skin regions most vulnerable to adverse events with TCS treatment, and their use may help overcome adherence issues due to patient bias against TCS.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Review", "Journal Article"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36997119/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy"]}, {"PMID": "36949024", "Title": "Non-biologic systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis: Current state of the art and future directions.", "Abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin condition with an unpredictable clinical course, associated with a significant impact on quality of life.

The literature has not yet established a single ubiquitous disease or term for these eruptions in adults over the age of 65\u00a0years. Instead, CEEA is attributed various names, including immunologic eruption of aging, and eruption of immunosenescence. Atopic dermatitis in the elderly, eczema in the elderly, and late- or adult-onset atopic dermatitis or eczema likely also fall under the umbrella of CEEA, given that older patients often do not meet strict criteria for atopic dermatitis. As a reflection of such terminological heterogeneity, CEEA does not have a standardized workup algorithm. This lack of uniformity can obscure the ability to study and understand appropriate treatments for this condition. Yet, as providers become increasingly aware of CEEA and more comfortable in making this diagnosis in older adults, it is necessary that dermatologists understand the safety and efficacy of common CEEA treatments in this population.

Although intense itch and excessive scratching behavior affect progression of skin lesions, it is unclear what causes them. Data suggest that scratching behavior stimulates brain dopaminergic reward and habit learning systems, strengthening habitual scratching behavior, while nocturnal scratching behavior presumably increases locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system activity, prompting sleep disturbances. At the early stage of atopic dermatitis, increased cortisol levels, due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivation caused by such system stimulation, can induce dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disturbance with reinforcement of habitual scratching behavior and may aggravate type-2-skewed immune responses in the skin. During the later phases, whereas blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and the shift of type-2-dominated to type-1-co-dominated inflammation are induced, noradrenergic system overactivation-associated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disruption is ongoing and responsible for itch cognitive distortion to catastrophize about itch, which leads to a vicious spiral along with habitual scratching behavior and skin lesions. Data are presented in this review indicating that while skin immune system dysfunction initiates pathologic changes in atopic dermatitis, brain neural network and stress system alterations can promote the progression of this condition. It is also suggested that cognitive distortion contributes to pathology in atopic dermatitis as with some psychiatric disorders and chronic pain. The proposed mechanistic model could lead to development of novel medications for slowing or terminating the relentless progression of this disorder. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although conventional pharmacological interventions focusing on skin homeostasis and itch occurrence significantly attenuate clinical signs in atopic dermatitis patients, achievement of 100% improvement is less than 40% in several double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Our model predicts that itch cognitive distortion, due to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex disturbance, can significantly contribute to the progression of atopic dermatitis and that agents capable of improving brain neural network, stress system, and skin homeostasis may be effective as interventions in the treatment of this condition.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36828629/", "Qualifers": ["drug therapy"]}, {"PMID": "36808298", "Title": "Chitosan-based drug delivery systems for skin atopic dermatitis: recent advancements and patent trends.", "Abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex, relapsing inflammatory skin disease with a considerable social and economic burden globally. AD is primarily characterized by its chronic pattern and it can have important modifications in the quality of life of the patients and caretakers. One of the fastest-growing topics in translational medicine today is the exploration of new or repurposed functional biomaterials into drug delivery therapeutic applications. This area has gained a considerable amount of research which produced many innovative drug delivery systems for inflammatory skin diseases like AD. Chitosan, a polysaccharide, has attracted attention as a functional biopolymer for diverse applications, especially in pharmaceutics and medicine, and has been considered a promising candidate for AD treatment due to its antimicrobial, antioxidative, and inflammatory response modulation properties. The current pharmacological treatment for AD involves prescribing topical corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitors. However, the adverse reactions associated with the long-term usage of these drugs such as itching, burning, or stinging sensation are also well documented. Innovative formulation strategies, including the use of micro- and nanoparticulate systems, biopolymer hydrogel composites, nanofibers, and textile fabrication are being extensively researched with an aim to produce a safe and effective delivery system for AD treatment with minimal side effects. This review outlines the recent development of various chitosan-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of AD published in the past 10\u00a0years (2012-2022).

To define and estimate meaningful treatment comparisons, several factors, including intercurrent events, must be taken into account. Intercurrent events are defined as events occurring after treatment initiation that affect either the interpretation or existence of the measurements associated with clinical questions of interest. Due to the relapsing, unpredictable nature of AD, intercurrent events frequently occur in AD trials, such as use of rescue therapy for intense itch and sleep deprivation. Despite the impact of intercurrent events in AD, they are often handled in an inconsistent manner across trials, which limits results interpretation. The estimand framework is increasingly used to estimate treatment effects while accounting for intercurrent events.

"GSE252821", "Summary": "Bioactive sphingolipids serve as an essential building block of membranes, forming a selective barrier ensuring subcellular compartmentalization and facilitating cell type-specific intercellular communication through regulation of the plasma membrane receptor repertoire. How the cell type-specific lipid compositions are achieved and what is their functional significance in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance has remained unclear. Here, we identify a stem-cell specific role for ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) in orchestrating fate decisions in the skin epidermis. Deletion of CerS4 in the epidermis prevents the effective establishment of the adult hair follicle bulge stem cell (HFSCs) niche due to altered differentiation trajectories of HFSC precursors towards upper hair follicle and inner bulge fates. Mechanistically, the HFSC differentiation defects arise from a stem cell intrinsic imbalance of key ceramides and sphingolipids, and associated hyperactivity of canonical Wnt signaling. The lack of HFSCs leads to disruption of hair follicle architecture and hair follicle barrier function, ultimately triggering a Th2-dominated immune infiltration closely resembling human atopic dermatitis. This work uncovers a fundamental role for a cell state-specific sphingolipid profile in epidermal stem cell homeostasis and the role of an intact stem cell niche in maintaining an intact skin barrier.", "Title": ["Sphingolipid metabolism orchestrates the establishment of the adult hair follicle stem cell niche to control skin homeostasis"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL19057": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["C57BL/6N mice with floxed CerS4 alleles were generated in cooperation with Taconic Artemis (Cologne, Germany).

Objective: To establish a molecular disease map of chronic idiopathic erythroderma. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing combined with T-cell receptor sequencing of blood and skin from 5 chronic idiopathic erythroderma (CIE) patients and compared results with 8 cases of erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (eCTCL), 15 moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), 10 psoriasis and 20 healthy control (HC) individuals. Results: In erythrodermic CTCL, we found strong expansion of CD4+ malignant clones with a CCR7+SELL+ central memory phenotype. By contrast, CIE exhibited a pattern of low-level, but consistent expansion of CD8A+KLRK1+ T-cell clones, both in blood and skin. KLRK1 was also expressed by CCR10+FUT7+ skin-homing CIE blood T-cells that had increased proliferation rates and were absent in all other conditions. While CIE and CTCL patients lacked the strong type 2 or type 17 immune skewing typically found in AD or psoriasis, respectively, they were characterized by upregulation of MHC II genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, CD74) in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, most likely in an IFNG-dependent fashion. However, we found strongest upregulation of type 1 immune mediators in CIE samples, both in the expanded CD8A+ clones, as well as in the tissue microenvironment. Conclusion: Despite the notion that CIE might be a mere bundle of various yet uncharacterized disease processes, we found specific pathogenic signatures in these patients, that were different from other forms of erythroderma. These data might help to improve our pathogenic understanding of the blood and skin compartments of CIE, aiding in discovery of future treatment targets.", "Title": ["Single-cell RNA sequencing of

Furthermore, the delineation from so-called \u201cparapsoriasis en plaque,\u201d a disease that can appear either in a small- or large-plaque form, is still controversial. Here, we characterize the parapsoriasis disease spectrum. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from patients within the parapsoriasis-to-early-stage MF spectrum, stratified for small and large plaques, and compared them to AD, psoriasis and healthy control skin. Results: 6 out of 8 large-plaque lesions harbored either an expanded alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell clone with downregulation of\u00a0CD7\u00a0expression, consistent with a diagnosis of early-stage MF. By contrast, 6 out of 7 small-plaque lesions were polyclonal in nature thereby lacking a lymphomatous phenotype, and also revealed a less inflammatory microenvironment than early-stage MF or AD. Of note, polyclonal small- and large-plaque lesions characteristically harbored a population of\u00a0NPY+\u00a0innate lymphoid cells and displayed a stromal signature of complement upregulation and antimicrobial hyperresponsiveness in fibroblasts and sweat gland cells, respectively. These conditions were clearly distinct from AD or psoriasis, which uniquely harbored CD3+CRTH2+ IL13-expressing \u201cTh2A\u201d cells or strong type 17 inflammation, respectively. Conclusion: These data position polyclonal small- and large-plaque dermatitis lesions as a separate disease entity, that characteristically harbors a so far undescribed ILC population. We thus propose the new term \u201cpolyclonal parapsoriasis en plaque\u201d to this kind of lesions, as they can be clearly differentiated from early and advanced-stage MF, psoriasis and AD on several

aberrant immune responses. Despite recent developments in new treatments for AD, there are still unmet needs for the disease management due to its complex and multifactorial nature. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified NLRP10 as an AD susceptible gene. However, the physiological role of NLRP10 in skin homeostasis and its relevance to AD are unknown. Here we show that NLRP10 promotes keratinocyte survival and facilitates epidermal differentiation and barrier function. Mechanistically, NLRP10 limits cell death by preventing the recruitment of caspase-8 onto the death inducing signaling complex and inhibiting its subsequent activation. NLRP10 also stabilizes p63, the master regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, to drive proper keratinocyte differentiation and to reinforce the barrier function. Importantly, NLRP10 is downregulated in AD skin samples. Our findings underscore NLRP10 as a key player in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis, highlighting NLRP10 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention to restore skin barrier function and homeostasis in AD.", "Title": ["NLRP10 Maintains Epidermal Homeostasis by Promoting Keratinocyte Survival and P63-Dependent Differentiation and Barrier Function"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20301": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["mRNA sequencing of  human skin equivalent cultures of NLRP-10 knockout (KO) and control wildtype (WT) primary normal human epidermis keratinocytes NHEKs."], "PubMedIDs": ["39424623"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39424623/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM8224078", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM8224079", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM8224080", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM8224081", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: NLRP-10 KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM8224082", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: NLRP-10 KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM8224083", "TissueType": "skin equivalent culture", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin equivalent culture", "cell line: NHEK", "treatment: differentiated into stratified epidermal layer", "genotype: NLRP-10 KO"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 4000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE244738", "Summary": "Skin barrier dysfunction initiates or deteriorates various cutaneous problems, such as atopic dermatitis (AD). In high concentrations, the nonreducing disaccharide \u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl \u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (trehalose) can induce transient senescence-like state in fibroblasts and promote wound repair. Here we have investigated the direct effect of a high concentration of trehalose on primary human keratinocytes (KCs) and demonstrated its specific role in the skin barrier. RNA-seq analysis revealed that trehalose regulates many skin-barrier-associated genes in T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13-treated and -untreated KCs. Using monolayer-cultured post-confluent normal human KCs and living skin equivalent (LSE), we identified IL-4/IL-13-downregulated differentiation markers and various epidermal antimicrobial proteins, all of which were significantly upregulated or restored by trehalose (60 mg/mL). Trehalose inhibited IL-33 expression and reduced nuclear IL-33 by activating MEK5- extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-5 and suppressing MEK1/2-ERK pathways. It also increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) activation via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), thus, neutralizing IL-4/IL-13-mediated oxidative stress. Trehalose prevented IL-4/IL-13-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT6 activation and restored various skin barrier molecules reduced by IL-4/IL-13 via IL-33 downregulation and Nrf2-HMOX1 activation.

Dysregulation in the epidermal differentiation process contributes to barrier dysfunction and is implicated in the pathology of various dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) is used as a moisturizing agent for xerosis in AD patients. However, its mechanism of action on keratinocytes, the main constituent of the epidermis, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of MPS on keratinocytes by subjecting adult human epidermal keratinocyte (HEKa) cells and three-dimensional cultured keratinocytes to MPS treatment, followed by transcriptome analysis. The analysis revealed that MPS treatment enhances keratinocyte differentiation and suppresses proliferation. We focused on amphiregulin (AREG), a membrane protein that belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and possesses a heparin-binding domain, as a significant target of the MPS among the genes altered by MPS. It is revealed that MPS exerts an inhibitory effect directly on AREG, rather than on the EGF receptor or other members of the EGF family. Furthermore, it is suggested that AREG leads to a reduction in epidermal barrier function, whereas MPS contributes to barrier enhancement through AREG inhibition. Collectively, these findings suggest that MPS modulates barrier function through the inhibition of AREG, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for skin barrier restoration.", "Title": ["Pharmacological impacts of Mucopolysacccharide Polyphosphates in skin involves inhibition of Amphiregulin-mediated signals in keratinocytes"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL18573": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["To invastigate the mechanism of MPS on keratinocyte, primary keratinocytes (HEKa) and 3D-cultured keratinocyte were treated by MPS.

This study aimed to determine whether P. affinis extracts can inhibit the pathogenesis of T-helper-2 (Th2)-mediated inflammation in a human keratinocyte cell line of atopic dermatitis (AD). Cells were incubated with 10 ng/mL of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and 10 ng/mL of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) at various concentrations of PAB (10, 30, and 60 \u00b5g/mL) and PAA (100, 500, and 1,000 \u00b5g/mL) extracts. A gene-ontology (GO)-enrichment analysis revealed that PAB significantly enriched the genes associated with biological processes such as cell adhesion, immune response, inflammation, and chemokine-mediated pathways. PAB suppressed the ex-pression of the secretory proteins and mRNAs that are associated with the thymus and the production of activation-regulated chemokines (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemo-kines (MDC/CCL22). The effect of the extract on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was related to its inhibition of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 production by blocking NF-\u03baB and STAT1 activation. These results suggest that seaweed extract may improve AD by regulating pro-inflammatory chemokines. In conclusion, we first confirmed the existence of phloroglucinol, a polyphenol formed from a precursor called phlorotannin, which is present in PAB, and this result proved the possibility of PAB being used as a treatment for AD.", "Title": ["Polyopes affinis Suppressed IFN-\u03b3- and TNF-\u03b1-Induced  Inflammation in Human Keratinocytes via Down-Regulation of the NF-\u03baB and STAT1 Pathways"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL18573": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["To investigate target genes and mechanism related to anti-inflammation by Polyopes affinis extract in HaCaT cell line stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, we performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-Seq of 3 groups(solvent control group, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 treated group, Polyopes affinis extract with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 treated group).

Endogenous ligands of the ECS, called endocannabinoids, have proven to be important regulators of immune responses. One of the most prevalent endocannabinoids, arachidonoylethanolamide (also known as anandamide), is known for its anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in various immune cells, weakens both humoral and cellular immune responses, and promotes cell migration. Langerhans cells (LCs) are the sole antigen-presenting cells present in the human epidermis. They serve as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are essential for the skin's specific immune responses and play a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis; however, little is known about the effect of endocannabinoids, specifically anandamide, on the biological functions of these cells. Our research aimed to provide the connection between monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (moLCs) and the ECS, shedding light on their collaborative roles in immune homeostasis and inflammation. Anandamide did not significantly affect the viability of moLCs up to 10 \u00b5M. When applied during the differentiation process it had only a negligible effect on CD207 expression, the prototypic marker of LCs; however, there was an observed reduction in CD1a expression by moLCs. Anandamide had no significant effects on the maturation status of moLCs, nor did it affect the maturation induced by TLR3 and TLR7/8 agonists. moLCs differentiated in the presence of anandamide did however show decreased production of CXCL8, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines induced by TLR3 and TLR7/8 activation. Anandamide-treated moLCs showed an increased capability to activate na\u00efve T cells; however, not to the level seen with combined TLR agonism. RNAseq analysis of moLCs differentiated with anandamide showed modest changes to the transcriptome of the cells but did reveal an inhibitory effect on oxidative phosphorylation specifically in activated moLCs. Anandamide also promoted the polarization of na\u00efve T cells towards a Th1 phenotype. Our results show that anandamide has nuanced effects on the differentiation, maturation, cytokine secretion, metabolism and function of activated moLCs. Among these changes the decrease in CD1a expression on moLCs holds promise to selectively dampen inflammation induced by CD1a restricted T cells, which have been implicated as drivers of inflammation in common inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis.", "Title": ["Differentiation of monocyte-derived Langerhans cells in the presence of anandamide affects the immunomodulatory action of the cells"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL18573": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["To determine the effect of anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide) on the dfferentiation of monocyte-derived Langerhans cells we cultured monocytes in a cytokine mixutre that induces their differentiation into Langerhans cells with and without anandamide.

characterized by dysregulated T cell immunity and skin microbiome dysbiosis with predominance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Emerging evidence suggests a role for S. aureus in exacerbating AD skin inflammation. Interestingly, specific glycosylation of S. aureus cell wall structures amplifies skin inflammation through interaction with Langerhans cells (LCs). However, the role of LCs in AD remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing of primary epidermal LCs and dermal T cells isolated from skin biopsies of AD patients and healthy controls, alongside specific glycoanalysis of S. aureus strains isolated from the AD lesions. Our findings reveal four LC subpopulations, including two steady-state clusters (LC1 and LC1H) and two pro-inflammatory/matured subsets (LC2 and migratory LCs). The latter two subsets were enriched in AD skin. AD LCs showed enhanced expression of C-type lectin receptors, the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5R1), and activation of prostaglandin and leukotrienes biosynthesis pathways, as well as upregulated transcriptional signatures related to T cell activation pathways and increased expression of CCL17 (specifically LC2) compared to healthy LCs. Correspondingly, T helper 2 and regulatory T cell populations were increased in AD lesions.

Dysregulation of this barrier is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD) and ichthyosis, with variable consequences for host immune control of colonizing commensals and opportunistic pathogens. While Malassezia is the most abundant commensal fungus of the skin, little is known about the host control of this fungus in inflammatory skin diseases. Here we show that in barrier-impaired skin, Malassezia acquires enhanced fitness and overt growth properties. By using four distinct and complementary murine models of atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis we provide evidence that structural and metabolic changes in the dysfunctional epidermal barrier environment provide increased accessibility and an altered lipid profile, to which the lipid-dependent yeast adapts for enhanced nutrient assimilation.

This lack is exacerbated by the difficulty of processing skin tissue for experimental analysis.

Here, we compare three digestion methods for human skin tissue, evaluating the cell yield and viability for each protocol.

Dead Sea Water (DSW) is well known for its dermatological benefits and has been widely used in dermatological therapy and skincare (e.g. psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and photoaging). However, the anti-aging and rejuvenating effects of DSW and the related biological pathways involved, which have attracted increasing attention, remain to be fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-aging and rejuvenating effects and to probe to explore the related potential biological mechanisms of DSW under different environmental conditions. METHODS: Using in vitro human dermal cells and reconstructed skin models, the effects of DSW treatment on the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and the morphological changes at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) were investigated. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of human dermal fibroblast models after DSW treatment was performed to explore the potential mechanisms of action of DSW under normal and UV stress conditions. RESULTS: The novel findings in this work present the biological functions of DSW, including procollagen-1 and elastin secretion, hemidesmosome increase, and the epidermal basal cell regeneration.

A multi-center cohort study revealed an increased risk of SCC and CAF-associated malignancies (breast and colorectal) in PN patients. Systemic fibroproliferative diseases (renal sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) were upregulated in PN patients. Ligand receptor analyses demonstrated a fibroblast neuronal axis with FB-derived WNT5A and periostin interactions with neuronal receptors MCAM and ITGAV.

Biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 axis are effective in AD, but there is still a large proportion of patients that do not respond to IL-4R blockade. Further exploration of potentially pathogenic T cell-derived cytokines in AD may lead to new effective treatments. This study aimed to investigate the downstream effects of IL-26 on skin in the context of type 2 skin inflammation. We found that IL-26 alone exhibited limited inflammatory activity in skin. However, in presence of IL-1\u03b2, IL-26 potentiated the secretion of TSLP, CXCL1 and CCL20 from human epidermis through JAK/STAT signaling. Moreover, in an in vivo AD-like skin inflammation model, IL-26 exacerbated skin pathology and locally increased type 2 cytokines, most notably of Il13 in skin T helper cells. Neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 abrogated IL-26-mediated effects, indicating that the presence of IL-1\u03b2 is required for full IL-26 downstream action in vivo. These findings suggest that the presence of IL-1\u03b2 enables IL-26 to be a key amplifier of inflammation in the skin.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization on the skin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD; however, the mechanism of how it modulates skin immunity to exacerbate AD remains unclear. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of genes. They are involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory skin diseases. In this study, we established miRNA expression profiles for keratinocytes stimulated with heat-killed S. aureus (HKSA). We found that miR-939 was highly upregulated in HKSA-stimulated keratinocytes and AD lesions. In vitro studies revealed that miR-939 increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes, including MMP1, MMP3, and MMP9, as well as the cell adhesion molecule ICAM1 in human primary keratinocytes. In vivo studies indicated that miR-939 increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinases to promote the colonization of S. aureus and exacerbated S. aureus-induced AD-like skin inflammation. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-939 is an important regulator of skin inflammation in AD.", "Title": ["Effect of miR-939 overexpression on gene expression in heat-killed S. aureus-stimulated keratinocytes"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL24676": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["To perform an unbiased study of miR-939 function in keratinocytes, we performed a global transcriptomic analysis in keratinocytes with miR-939 overexpression followed by HKSA stimulation.

(EoE) is a rare atopic disorder associated with esophageal dysfunction, including difficulty swallowing, food impaction, and inflammation. EoE develops in a small subset of people with food allergies under the influence of environmental and genetic risk factors. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 31 independent risk loci for the disease, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) expansion of these loci nominates a set of 531 variants that are potentially causal. These risk variants are non-coding, suggesting a likely role in altered gene regulatory mechanisms. To systematically interrogate the gene regulatory activity of these variants, we designed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) containing the alleles of each variant within their 170 bp genomic sequence context cloned into a GFP reporter library. Transfection of the MPRA library into TE-7 esophageal epithelial cells, HaCaT skin keratinocytes, and Jurkat T cells revealed cell-type-specific gene regulation. We identify 32 allelic enhancer variants (allelic enVars) that regulate reporter gene expression in a genotype-dependent manner in at least one cellular context. By annotating these variants with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin looping data in related tissues and cell types, we identify putative target genes affected by genetic variation in EoE patients, including TSLP and multiple genes at the HLA locus. Transcription factor enrichment analyses reveal possible roles for cell-type specific regulators, including GATA-3, a key regulator of type 2 inflammation. Collectively, our approach reduces the large set of EoE-associated variants to a set of 32 with allelic regulatory activity, providing new functional insights into the effects of genetic variation in this disease.", "Title": ["Systematic identification of genotype-dependent enhancer variants in eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis [RNA-Seq]"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL24676": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["RNA-seq to identify genes differentially expressed in unstimulated versus IL-13 stimulated cells, 2-3 replicates, 2 conditions, 2 cell types"], "PubMedIDs": ["38183988"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38183988/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM7328796", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: unstimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328797", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: unstimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328798", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: unstimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328799", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: IL-13 stimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328800", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: IL-13 stimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328801", "TissueType": "TE-7", "Characteristics": ["cell line: TE-7", "treatment: IL-13 stimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328802", "TissueType": "HaCaT", "Characteristics": ["cell line: HaCaT", "treatment: unstimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328803", "TissueType": "HaCaT", "Characteristics": ["cell line: HaCaT", "treatment: unstimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328804", "TissueType": "HaCaT", "Characteristics": ["cell line: HaCaT", "treatment: IL-13 stimulated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7328805", "TissueType": "HaCaT", "Characteristics": ["cell line: HaCaT", "treatment: IL-13 stimulated"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NovaSeq 6000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE244201", "Summary": "Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic, pruritic skin disease, affects 10%-30% of children and up to 14% of adults in developed countries.

Furthermore, the delineation from so-called \u201cparapsoriasis en plaque,\u201d a disease that can appear either in a small- or large-plaque form, is still controversial. Here, we characterize the parapsoriasis disease spectrum. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from patients within the parapsoriasis-to-early-stage MF spectrum, stratified for small and large plaques, and compared them to AD, psoriasis and healthy control skin. Results: 6 out of 8 large-plaque lesions harbored either an expanded alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell clone with downregulation of\u00a0CD7\u00a0expression, consistent with a diagnosis of early-stage MF. By contrast, 6 out of 7 small-plaque lesions were polyclonal in nature thereby lacking a lymphomatous phenotype, and also revealed a less inflammatory microenvironment than early-stage MF or AD. Of note, polyclonal small- and large-plaque lesions characteristically harbored a population of\u00a0NPY+\u00a0innate lymphoid cells and displayed a stromal signature of complement upregulation and antimicrobial hyperresponsiveness in fibroblasts and sweat gland cells, respectively. These conditions were clearly distinct from AD or psoriasis, which uniquely harbored CD3+CRTH2+ IL13-expressing \u201cTh2A\u201d cells or strong type 17 inflammation, respectively.

"Summary": "A life-essential function of the epidermis is to provide a physical barrier that prevents the loss of water and electrolytes. Essential mediators of this permeability barrier function include ceramides, cholesterol and very long chain fatty acids. Accordingly, their alteration may lead to distinct human conditions, including psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Recently, a frameshift mutation in the human ZNF750 gene, that encodes for a zinc finger transcription factor, causing a seborrhea-like dermatitis with psoriasiform element, has brought ZNF750 as a key element for the maintenance of the epidermal tissue homeostasis. To clarify this hypothesis, with its underlying molecular mechanism, we generated a novel mouse knockout by deleting exon 2. Here, we show that genetic deletion of the mouse homolog ZFP750 results in loss of epidermal permeability barrier function. ZFP750-/- mice die shortly after birth, within 12 hours. In the stratum corneum of ZFP750-/- mice levels of ceramides, nonpolar lipids and intercellular lipid lamellae are significantly reduced. The alteration of the epidermal lipid homeostasis is directly linked to the transcriptional activity of ZFP750. Indeed, in addition to epidermal differentiation genes, ZFP750 directly and/or indirectly regulates the expression of nearly 50 crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis of ceramides, such as SPTLC1, DGAT2, SMPD3, ELOVL7 and DEGS2. Overall, our study identifies the transcription factor ZFP750 as a master regulator of lipid biosynthesis and epidermal homeostasis and may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of several human skin diseases.", "Title": ["ZFP750 regulates skin lipid metabolism and cutaneous barrier"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL19057": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data of ZFP750-/- vs Wild-type mice."], "PubMedIDs": ["37115925"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115925/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM6820572", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: ZFP750-/-", "treatment: KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820573", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: ZFP750-/-", "treatment: KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820574", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: ZFP750-/-", "treatment: KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820575", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: ZFP750-/-", "treatment: KO"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820576", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: WT", "treatment: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820577", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: WT", "treatment: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820578", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: WT", "treatment: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6820579", "TissueType": "skin \u2013 epidermis", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: skin - epidermis", "genotype: WT", "treatment: WT"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NextSeq 500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE209704", "Summary": "Evaluate the therapeutic effects of different delivery route of MSC treantment in DNCB induced atopic dermatitis mice model.", "Title": ["RNASeq of skin tissues by Mesenchymal stem cells treatment on DNCB induced mice model"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL19057": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["12 Balb/C mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and the hairs of dorsal skin were shaved two days before sensitization.

However, the intended anti-tumor effects also result in a unique form of autoimmunity, known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which have emerged as a limiting factor for many immunotherapies. Cutaneous irAEs (cirAEs), the most frequently occurring ICI\u2013related toxicities, have been associated with improved efficacy and survival but, in their severe forms, require systemic steroids and have in cases led to premature ICI discontinuation and fatality. There is a need for both robust biomarkers and adequate models that effectively predict which patients who develop irAEs may have improved outcomes. Using a microfluidic droplet technology that generates \"mini\" patient-derived organoids called MicroOrganoSpheres (MOSTM), we successfully generated skin MOS from skin biopsy samples in both healthy skin and tumor-involved skin that sustain the original patient skin immune microenvironment over three weeks. Using this model, we assessed skin cell toxicity and cytokine release in response to ICI and targeted therapies. Clinical responses were largely consistent with the skin and tumor MOS assay readouts, indicating that MOS recapitulates the potential association between skin irAEs and efficacy. Matched pairs of patient melanoma and skin MOS showed good concordance with patient outcome indicating that MOS recapitulates the potential association between skin irAEs and efficacy. Enrichment of genes associated with atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and psoriatic dermatitis were observed in MOS generated from skin of an ICI-sensitive patient compared to the MOS generated from skin of an ICI-resistant patient. These results indicated that the skin MOS platform can potentially predict the dermatological toxicity of ICI. As the MOS assay can be completed within 12 days after biopsy acquisition, this novel technology may enable personalized medicine approaches by prediction of cirAEs and efficacy for individual patients.", "Title": ["Gene expression changes in matched tumor and skin biospy in melanoma patients treated with atezolizumab"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL16791": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["MOS generated from matched skin and tumor tissue biopsies from 2 melanoma patients were treated with atezolizumab to determine correlation between treatment sensitivity and gene expression changes."], "PubMedIDs": [], "PubMedURLs": [], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM7086118", "TissueType": "Melanoma", "Characteristics": ["sample id: MN1", "tissue: Melanoma", "sample type: MOS", "genotype: Unknown", "treatment: Atezolizumab", "clinical response: resistant"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7086119", "TissueType": "Skin", "Characteristics": ["sample id: MN1", "tissue: Skin", "sample type: MOS", "genotype: Unknown", "treatment: Atezolizumab", "clinical response: resistant"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7086120", "TissueType": "Melanoma", "Characteristics": ["sample id: MN4", "tissue: Melanoma", "sample type: MOS", "genotype: Unknown", "treatment: Atezolizumab", "clinical response: hospice, no treatment"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7086121", "TissueType": "Skin", "Characteristics": ["sample id: MN4", "tissue: Skin", "sample type: MOS", "genotype: Unknown", "treatment: Atezolizumab", "clinical response: hospice, no treatment"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 2500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE222019", "Summary": "", "Title": ["Effect of topical emollient on the development of atopic dermatitis and atopic march in a mice model"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL24247": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["The study samples are from control mice, AD mice and AD mice treated with a linoleic acid-ceramide-containing emollient (3 mice each group).

stratified epidermis, but the precise interaction between the keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation status and the skin microbiome has not been fully explored. We hypothesised that the skin microbiome contributes to regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and can modify antimicrobial responses. Therefore, we examined the effect of exposure to topical commensal or pathogenic Staphylococcal challenge on skin models. To further explore the cell types regulating inhibition specifically targeting SA, single-cell DropSeq analysis of unchallenged na\u00efve, SE challenged, and SA challenged epidermis models was undertaken. Transcriptomic analysis distinguished cells from basal, spinous, and granular layers which could then be interrogated individually in relation to model exposure. In contrast to SE, SA specifically induced a sub-population of spinous cells which highly expressed transcripts related to epidermal inflammation and antimicrobial response such as IL36G, IVL, IL1RN, KLK7, PI3, MMP1, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, SERPINB1, SERPINB2, SERPINB3, and SLPI.

However, the extent to which CD1a presents microbial ligands from skin bacteria is unclear. Here, we identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid, as well as to lysyl phosphatidylglycerol (lysylPG), a modified PG, present in the many gram positive bacteria, and highly abundant in Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically, PG and lysylPG together constitute the vast majority of the structural membrane lipids in Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-lysylPG complex showed that the acyl chains were buried within the A\u2032- and F\u2032-pockets of CD1a, while the lysine-modified phosphoglycerol headgroup protruded from the F\u2032-portal and was available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG-loaded CD1a tetramers, we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to this lipid in a dose dependent manner. Tetramer+ CD4+ T cell lines secreted Th2 cytokines in response to lysylPG as well as to co-cultures of CD1a+ dendritic cells and Staphylococcus aureus.

Impaired skin barrier function is linked with enhanced allergen sensitization and the development of diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), which can precede the development of other allergic diseases such as food allergies and asthma. Epidemiological evidence indicates that children suffering from allergies have lower levels of dietary fibre-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Using an experimental model of AD, we report that a fermentable fibre-rich diet alleviates AD severity and systemic allergen sensitization. The gut-skin axis underpins this phenomenon through SCFA, which strengthen skin barrier integrity by altering mitochondrial metabolism of epidermal keratinocytes. SCFA promote keratinocyte differentiation and the production of key structural lipids, resulting in enhanced barrier function. Our results demonstrate that dietary fibre and SCFA mitigate AD by improving barrier integrity, ultimately limiting early systemic allergen sensitization and development of disease.", "Title": ["Gut-derived short-chain fatty acids modulate skin barrier integrity by promoting keratinocyte metabolism and differentiation"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL17021": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["16 Samples, 4 groups in duplicate"], "PubMedIDs": ["35672452"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35672452/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5621031", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: Vehicle", "disease state: Baseline", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621032", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: Vehicle", "disease state: Baseline", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621033", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: SCFA", "disease state: Baseline", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621034", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: SCFA", "disease state: Baseline", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621035", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: Vehicle", "disease state: Atopic dermatitis", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621036", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: Vehicle", "disease state: Atopic dermatitis", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621037", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: SCFA", "disease state: Atopic dermatitis", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5621038", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["treatment: SCFA", "disease state: Atopic dermatitis", "age: 6-8 week old", "strain: BALB/c"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 2500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE166855", "Summary": "We analyzed dermal macrophage repertoire derived from PDGFRa-lineage or non-PDGFRa-lineage origin in atopic dermatitis (AD) with single-cell RNA sequencing.

and its main role is to boost differentiation and function of effector T cells. ICOS is also constitutively expressed in a subpopulation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells under steady-state condition. Studies using ICOS germline knockout mice or ICOS-blocking reagents suggested that ICOS has supportive roles in regulatory T (Treg) cell homeostasis, migration, and function. To avoid any compounding effects that may arise from ICOS-deficient non-Treg cells, we generated a conditional knockout system in which ICOS expression is selectively abrogated in Foxp3-expressing cells (ICOS FC mice). Compared to Foxp3-Cre control mice, ICOS FC mice showed a minor numerical deficit of steady-state Treg cells but did not show any signs of spontaneous autoimmunity, indicating that tissue-protective Treg populations do not heavily rely on ICOS costimulation. However, ICOS FC mice showed more severe inflammation in oxazolone-induced contact hypersensitivity, a model of atopic dermatitis. This correlated with elevated numbers of inflammatory T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1 in ICOS FC mice compared with the control group. In contrast, elimination of ICOS in all T cell compartments negated the differences, confirming that ICOS has a dual positive role in effector and Treg cells. Single-cell transcriptome analysis suggested that ICOS-deficient Treg cells fail to mature into T-bet+CXCR3+ \u201cTh1-Treg\u201d cells in the draining lymph node. Our results suggest that regimens that preferentially stimulate ICOS pathways in Treg cells might be beneficial for the treatment of Th1-driven inflammation.", "Title": ["ICOS-deficient Treg cells can prevent spontaneous autoimmunity but are impaired in controlling acute inflammation"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL24247": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Comparing ICOS WT and ICOS-deficient (ICOS FC) Tregs in steady-state and inflammation conditions."], "PubMedIDs": ["35760518"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35760518/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5608832", "TissueType": "T regulatory cells", "Characteristics": ["tissue: spleen", "strain: C57BL/6", "condition: Steady state", "genotype: ICOS WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5608833", "TissueType": "T regulatory cells", "Characteristics": ["tissue: spleen", "strain: C57BL/6", "condition: Steady state", "genotype: ICOS-deficient"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5608834", "TissueType": "T regulatory cells", "Characteristics": ["tissue: cervical draining lymph nodes", "strain: C57BL/6", "condition: Oxazolone", "genotype: ICOS WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5608835", "TissueType": "T regulatory cells", "Characteristics": ["tissue: cervical draining lymph nodes", "strain: C57BL/6", "condition: Oxazolone", "genotype: ICOS-deficient"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NovaSeq 6000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE185710", "Summary": "Pro-inflammatory fibroblasts are critical to pathogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial lung disease, and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, and represent a novel therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory disease.

differentiation and have led the way to targeted biologic therapies that are effective in a range of autoimmune, allergic, and inflammatory diseases. More recent evidence indicates that obesity and other shifts in systemic metabolism can also influence the function of cells in the immune system, although the mechanisms and possible effects on immunotherapy outcomes remain largely unknown. Here, using two models of atopic dermatitis (AD), we show that lean and obese mice mount strikingly different immune responses.\u00a0Obesity converts the classical AD-associated type 2 T helper cell (TH2)-predominant disease into a more severe disease with prominent TH17 inflammation.\u00a0In addition to this immunopathologic difference, we observed strikingly divergent responses to biologic therapies targeting TH2 cytokines, which robustly protected lean mice but significantly exacerbated disease in obese mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with genome-wide binding analysis revealed decreased activity in nuclear receptor PPARg (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) activity in TH2 cells from obese mice relative to lean mice. Conditional ablation of PPARg in T cells identified a novel function for PPARg as required for focusing the in vivo\u00a0TH response towards a TH2-predominant state and preventing aberrant non-TH2 inflammation. Treatment of obese mice with a small molecule PPARg\u00a0agonist prevented development of TH17 pathology in AD and unlocked robust therapeutic responsiveness to targeted anti-TH2 biologics.\u00a0These studies reveal the effects of obesity on immunological disease and demonstrate a precision medicine approach to target the immune dysregulation caused by obesity to restore efficacy of a biological immunotherapy.", "Title": ["Correcting altered immunological responses in obesity restores efficacy of targeted biologic therapy for inflammatory disease"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL21103": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Mice were challenged with MC903-AD on their ears, and lesional CD4+ T cells were isolated by FACS sorting on Day 10 of the challenge for single cell sequencing using the 10X platform."], "PubMedIDs": ["35355021"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35355021/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5702410", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 1,2", "agent: N/A", "diet: Normal Chow"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702411", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 1,2", "agent: N/A", "diet: High Fat Diet"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702412", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 1,2", "agent: N/A", "diet: Normal Chow"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702413", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 1,2", "agent: N/A", "diet: Normal Chow"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702414", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 3", "agent: N/A", "diet: High Fat Diet"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702415", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 3", "agent: N/A", "diet: High Fat Diet"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702416", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 3", "agent: Rosiglitazone", "diet: High Fat Diet"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5702417", "TissueType": "sorted lesional skin CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "main figures: 3", "agent: Rosiglitazone", "diet: High Fat Diet"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 4000"], "StudyType": "scRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE189751", "Summary": "The epidermis, outermost layer of the skin, forms a barrier and is involved in innate and adaptive immunity in an organism. Keratinocytes participate in all these three protective processes. However, a regulator of keratinocyte protective responses against external dangers and stresses remains elusive. We found that upregulation of the orphan gene 2610528A11Rik was a common factor in the skin of mice with several types of inflammation. In the human epidermis, peptide expression of G protein-coupled receptor 15 ligand (GPR15L), encoded by the human ortholog C10orf99, was highly induced in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. C10orf99 gene transfection into normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) induced the expression of inflammatory mediators and reduced the expression of barrier-related genes. Gene ontology analyses showed its association with translation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitochondria, and lipid metabolism. Treatment with GPR15L reduced the expression levels of filaggrin and loricrin in human keratinocyte 3D cultures. Instead, their expression levels in mouse primary cultured keratinocytes did not show significant differences between the wild-type and 2610528A11Rik deficient keratinocytes. Lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of Il1b and Il6 was less in 2610528A11Rik deficient mouse keratinocytes than in wild-type, and imiquimod-induced psoriatic dermatitis was blunted in 2610528A11Rik deficient mice. Furthermore, repetitive subcutaneous injection of GPR15L in mouse ears induced skin inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that C10orf99/GPR15L is a primary inducible regulator that reduces the barrier formation and induces the inflammatory response of keratinocytes.", "Title": ["C10orf99/GPR15L Regulates Proinflammatory Response of Keratinocytes and Barrier Formation of the Skin"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20301": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Transcriptomes from Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) in untreated, empty vector-transfected, or C10orf99-transfected conditions (3 replicates per condition)"], "PubMedIDs": ["35273606"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273606/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5706729", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Untreated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706730", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Untreated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706731", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Untreated"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706732", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Empty vector-transfected"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706733", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Empty vector-transfected"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706734", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: Empty vector-transfected"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706735", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: C10orf99-transfected"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706736", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: C10orf99-transfected"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5706737", "TissueType": "Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK)", "Characteristics": ["transfection: C10orf99-transfected"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 4000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE170673", "Summary": "In this study, we define a novel phenotypic and functional dichotomy of human dendritic cells (DC), with strong relevance to cancer, allergy, and autoimmunity.

Despite recent advances in understanding Staphylococcus species infection and the impact of polar TH cytokines on the skin, the interactions between these factors in AD pathology are poorly understood. Methods: AD-related key immune biomarkers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in human keratinocytes exposed heat-killed S. epidermidis or S. aureus with/without polar T-cell derived cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 (TH1), IL-4/IL-13 (TH2), and IL-22 (TH22). Further analysis was performed by RNA-sequencing to define broader responses in both Staphylococcus species and polar cytokines. The similarity of gene expression patterns in AD skin lesions and stimulated keratinocytes was evaluated by gene-set variation analysis (GSVA). Results: Gene expression analysis exhibited distinct immune responses in keratinocytes depending on individual bacterial or polar cytokine exposure. Besides, numerous genes were synergistically upregulated by the combination exposure of bacteria and polar TH cytokines. Moreover, GSVA revealed that combined exposure of S. aureus and IL-4 + IL-13 exhibited significantly higher correlations with a genomic signature of AD skin lesions than their single exposure or combinations of other polar TH cytokines.

exists about phenotype and function of cutaneous T lymphocytes, much less is known about the lymphocytic components of the skin\u2019s innate immune system. Objective: To better understand the biologic role of cutaneous innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), we investigated their phenotypic and molecular features under physiologic (normal human skin [NHS]) and pathologic (lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis [AD]) conditions. Methods: Skin punch biopsies and reduction sheets as well as blood specimens were obtained from either patients with AD or healthy individuals. Cell and/or tissue samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing or subjected to in vitro / ex vivo culture. Results: Notwithstanding substantial quantitative differences between NHS and AD skin, we found that the vast majority of cutaneous ILCs belong to the CRTH2+ subset and reside in the upper skin layers. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cutaneous ILC-enriched cell samples confirmed the predominance of biologically heterogeneous group 2 ILCs and, for the first time, demonstrated considerable ILC lineage infidelity (coexpression of genes typical of either type 2 [GATA3 and IL13] or type 3/17 [RORC, IL22, and IL26] immunity within individual cells) in lesional AD skin, and to a much lesser extent, in NHS. Similar events were demonstrated in ILCs from skin explant cultures and in vitro expanded ILCs from the peripheral blood. Conclusion: These findings support the concept that instead of being a stable entity with well-defined components, the skin immune system consists of a network of highly flexible cellular players that are capable of adjusting their function to the needs and challenges of the environment.", "Title": ["Single-cell analysis reveals innate lymphoid cell lineage infidelity in atopic dermatitis"],

morphogens which regulate embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, with distinct outcomes dependent on the strength and duration of their signals. We show that the Hh signalling pathway modulates the induction and pathology of mouse atopic dermatitis. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Hh pathway target genes were upregulated on induction of atopic dermatitis, and the Hh pathway was activated in skin T cells, showing that they respond in vivo to Hh signals secreted from the skin. Shh upregulation reduced skin inflammation in mice, whereas pharmacological Smoothened-inhibition reduced Shh upregulation and exacerbated skin pathology. Hh-signalling to T cells prevented skin inflammation on induction of dermatitis, while inhibition of Hh-mediated transcription in T cells substantially exacerbated the disease. RNA-sequencing analysis of skin CD4+ T cells from mice with chronic atopic dermatitis revealed decreased expression of immune regulatory genes in mice with conditional inhibition of Hh-mediated transcription in T cells, and increased expression of inflammatory and chemokine genes. In contrast, constitutive Hh mediated transcription in T cells led to increased expression of immune regulatory genes in skin CD4+ T cells from mice with chronic atopic dermatitis and protected against inflammation. Hh-mediated transcription in T cells resulted in increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in the periphery and skin of dermatitis-induced mice, and increased TGF-\u03b2 expression, supporting their immunoregulatory phenotype, whereas, inhibition of T cell specific Hh-mediated transcription, resulted in impaired Treg function, which permitted progression of skin inflammation.", "Title": ["Sonic Hedgehog signalling to T cells limits induction of chronic murine atopic dermatitis via Gli2-driven immune regulatory function"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL19057": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Skin from Wildtype, Gli2\u0394N2 and Gli2\u0394C2 transgenic mice (n=2) was sorted for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Upregulation of the NF-kB pathway may lead to the development of chronic inflammatory disorders of the skin, but the early events in situ are not well understood. Through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data via iterative Random Forest Leave One Out Prediction (iRF-LOOP), an explainable artificial intelligence (X-AI) method, we identified an immunoregulatory role for a unique Prx1+ fibroblast subpopulation. Disruption of Ikkb/NFkB under homeostatic conditions in these fibroblasts paradoxically induced skin inflammation due to the over-expression of CCL11 (eotaxin-1) characterized by eosinophil infiltration and a subsequent Th2 immune response. Because the inflammatory phenotype resembled that seen in human atopic dermatitis (AD), we examined validated human AD skin samples and found that human AD fibroblasts also over-expressed CCL11 compared to control skin. Importantly, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibody treatment against CCL11 was therapeutically effective in reducing the eosinophilia and Th2 inflammation in vivo. Taken together, the murine model and human AD specimens point to dysregulated Prx1+ fibroblasts as a previously unrecognized etiologic factor that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD-like lesions and suggest targeting CCL11 as a novel way to treat AD-like lesions.", "Title": ["NF-kB Perturbation Reveals Unique Immunomodulatory Functions in Prx1+ Fibroblasts that Promote Atopic Dermatitis"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL21103": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Ventral skin single-cell mRNA profiles of 4 week old wild type (WT) and Prx1Cre+Ikkbf/f (Ikkb-deleted) mice."], "PubMedIDs": [], "PubMedURLs": [], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5244390", "TissueType": "Ventral skin", "Characteristics": ["age: post natal day 28", "genotype: wild type", "strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: ventral skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5244391", "TissueType": "Ventral skin", "Characteristics": ["age: post natal day 28", "genotype: wild type", "strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: ventral skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5244392", "TissueType": "Ventral skin", "Characteristics": ["age: post natal day 28", "genotype: Prx1Cre+Ikkbf/f", "strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: ventral skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5244393", "TissueType": "Ventral skin", "Characteristics": ["age: post natal day 28", "genotype: Prx1Cre+Ikkbf/f", "strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: ventral skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5244394", "TissueType": "Ventral skin", "Characteristics": ["age: post natal day 28", "genotype: Prx1Cre+Ikkbf/f", "strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: ventral skin"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 4000"], "StudyType": "scRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE162925", "Summary": "Essential to terrestrial life is the formation of a competent skin barrier that prevents desiccation and entry by harmful substances. A tightly orchestrated series of cellular changes is required for the proper formation of the epidermal permeability barrier. These changes occur in the context of the commensal skin microbiota. Using germ free mice and antibiotic depletion models, we demonstrate the microbiota is necessary for proper differentiation and repair of the barrier. These effects were mediated by keratinocyte signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a xenobiotic receptor that also regulates epidermal differentiation. Murine skin lacking keratinocyte AHR was more susceptible to infection by S. aureus and increased pathology in a model of atopic dermatitis. Topical colonization with a defined consortium of human skin commensals restored barrier competence in germ free skin and during epicutaneous sensitization; these effects were dependent on keratinocyte AHR. We reveal a fundamental role for the commensal skin microbiota in directing skin barrier formation and repair through the AHR, with far-reaching implications for the numerous skin disorders

Despite an increased understanding of AD, factors guiding its natural course are only insufficiently elucidated. We thus performed suction blistering in skin of adult patients with stable, spontaneous remission from previous moderate-to-severe AD during childhood. Samples were compared to healthy controls without personal or familial history of atopy, and to chronic, active AD lesions. Skin cells and tissue fluid obtained were used for single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomic multiplex assays, respectively. We found overall cell composition and proteomic profiles of spontaneously healed AD to be comparable to healthy control skin, without upregulation of typical AD activity markers (e.g., IL13, S100As, and KRT16). Among all cell types in spontaneously healed AD, melanocytes harbored the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes in comparison to healthy controls, with upregulation of potentially anti-inflammatory markers such as PLA2G7. Conventional T-cells also showed increases in regulatory markers, and a general skewing toward a more Th1-like phenotype. By contrast, gene expression of regulatory T-cells and keratinocytes was essentially indistinguishable from healthy skin. Melanocytes and conventional T-cells might thus contribute a specific regulatory milieu in spontaneously healed AD skin.", "Title": ["Spontaneously resolved atopic dermatitis shows melanocyte and immune cell activation distinct from healthy control skin"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL21290": "Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Skin cells from patients with spontaneously resolved atopic dermatitis were compared to healthy controls without personal or familial history of atopy, and to chronic, active AD lesions.", "", ">>>Raw data are unavailable due to patient privacy concerns<<<"], "PubMedIDs": ["33717163"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33717163/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM4932358", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "diagnosis: Spontaneously healed atopic dermatitis", "atopic comorbidities: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4932359", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "diagnosis: Spontaneously healed atopic dermatitis", "atopic comorbidities: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4932360", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "diagnosis: Spontaneously healed atopic dermatitis", "atopic comorbidities: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4932361", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "diagnosis: Spontaneously healed atopic dermatitis", "atopic comorbidities: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 3000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE158432", "Summary": "Therapeutic options for autoimmune diseases typically consist of broad and targeted immunosuppressive agents. However, a sustained clinical benefit is rarely achieved, as the disease phenotype usually returns after cessation of treatment. To better understand this kind of tissue-resident \u201cimmune memory\u201d in human disease, we investigated patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), who underwent short-term or long-term treatment with the IL-4R\u03b1 blocker dupilumab. Using multi-omics profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplex proteomics, we found significant decreases in overall skin immune cell counts, and normalization of transcriptomic dysregulation in keratinocytes consistent with clearance of disease. However, we identified specific immune cell populations that persisted for up to a year after clinical remission, while being absent from healthy controls. These included LAMP3+ CCL22+ mature dendritic cells, CRTH2+ CD161+ T helper (\u201cTh2A\u201d) cells, and CRTAM+ cytotoxic T-cells, which expressed high levels of CCL17 (dendritic cells) and IL13 (T-cells). Th2A cells showed a unique cytokine receptor constellation of IL17RB, IL1RL1 (ST2) and CRLF2 expression, suggesting that these are key responders to the AD-typical epidermal alarmins IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, respectively. We thus identified characteristic immune cell populations in resolved AD indicative of a persisting disease memory, facilitating a rapid response system of epidermal-dermal crosstalk between keratinocytes, dendritic cells and Tcells. This observation may explain the disease recurrence upon termination of immunosuppressive treatments in AD, and it identifies cell types that may be targeted to achieve a more sustained therapeutic response.", "Title": ["Persistence of mature dendritic cells, Th2A and Tc2 cells characterize clinically resolved atopic dermatitis under IL-4R-alpha blockade"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL21290": "Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Comparison of skin cells from patients without and with short-term (16 weeks) or long-term (1 year) treatment with the IL-4R\u03b1 blocker   dupilumab", "", ">>>Raw data are unvailable due to patient privacy concerns<<<"], "PubMedIDs": ["33483337"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33483337/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM4800170", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (16 weeks)", "easi score (reduction): 15.9 (64.4)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800171", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (16 weeks)", "easi score (reduction): 10.1 (70.5)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800172", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (16 weeks)", "easi score (reduction): 2.4 (94.69)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800173", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: untreated", "easi score (reduction): 27.4 (0)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800174", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (1 year)", "easi score (reduction): 3.2 (92.9)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800175", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (1 year)", "easi score (reduction): 2.6 (90.0)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800176", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (1 year)", "easi score (reduction): 1.1 (97.4)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800177", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (16 weeks)", "easi score (reduction): 9 (50.0)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800178", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (16 weeks)", "easi score (reduction): 5.4 (80.3)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4800179", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin cell", "treatment: Dupilumab (1 year)", "easi score (reduction): 11.2 (74.8)", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 3000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE156875", "Summary": "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that acts directly on CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells to promote progression of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic inflammation.

Non-invasive techniques will facilitate study recruitment of e.g. patients with pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD), hand eczema or facial dermatitis. Objective: By RNA sequencing, we examined whether the stratum corneum transcriptome in AD skin can be assessed by tape stripping, as compared to the epidermal transcriptome of AD in skin biopsies. To make the procedure clinically relevant tape strips were stored and shipped at room temperature for up to 3 days. Methods: Nine adult Caucasian AD patients and three healthy volunteers were included. Tape samples were collected from non-lesional and lesional skin. Biopsies were collected from lesional skin and were split into epidermis and dermis. Total RNA was extracted, and shotgun sequencing was performed. Results: Shotgun sequencing could be performed on skin cells obtained from two consecutive tape strips which had been stored and shipped at room temperature for up to three days. The most prominent differences between the tape strip and biopsy derived transcriptome were due to structural genes, while established molecular markers of AD, including CCL17, CCL22, IL17A and S100A7-S100A9, were also identified in tape strip samples. Furthermore, the tape strip derived transcriptome showed promise in also analysing the skin microbiome.

"Breastfeeding is thought to influence the immune system development of infants and may even affect various immunological responses later in life. Breast milk provides a rich source of early nutrition for the growth and developmental of infants. However, the presence of certain compounds in breast milk related to an unhealthy lifestyle or the diet of lactating mothers may negatively impact infants6. Based on a cohort study, we found that the composition of mother\u2019s milk containing high amount of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCSFAs) was related to a higher incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children. Similarly, a mouse model in which breastfed offspring were fed milk high in LCSFAs also resulted in AD onset later in life. We showed that LCSFAs are damage-associated molecular patterns, which initiate a series of inflammatory events in the gut involving type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). A remarkable increase in inflammatory ILC3s was observed in the gut, and the migration of these ILC3s to the skin contributed to the pathogenesis of AD. Gene expression analysis of ILC3s isolated from the gut revealed up-regulation of genes that increase ILC3s and chemokines, which may play a role in ILC migration to the skin. Even in the absence of adaptive immunity, Rag1 knockout mice fed a high-LCSFA milk diet developed eczema, accompanied by increased gut ILC3s. Here, we propose that early exposure to LCSFAs in infants may affect the balance of intestinal innate immunity, inducing a highly inflammatory environment with the proliferation of ILC3s and production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22, which are attributed to the pathogenesis of AD.", "Title": ["Long-chain saturated fatty acids in breast milk are associated with the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis via inducing inflammatory ILC3s"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL17021": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Examination of ILC3s from intraepithelial and lamina propria layer of two different mice groups, comparison between normal or fed with maternal milk with high saturated fatty acids"], "PubMedIDs": ["34162906"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34162906/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM3523528", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523529", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523530", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523531", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523532", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523533", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: PA-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523534", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523535", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523536", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Intraepithelial ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523537", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523538", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM3523539", "TissueType": "Intestinal lymphocytes", "Characteristics": ["strain: HR-1", "milk-diet: Normal-milk", "cell type: Lamina propria ILC3s"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 2500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE146184", "Summary": "Dysbiosis is increasingly implicated as a targetable contributor to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD).

"T-bet and STAT6 are critical factors for helper T cell differentiation in humans and mice. Additionally, polymorphisms in TBX21 (T-bet) and STAT6 are associated with the susceptibility of allergic diseases. However, precise mechanisms of the reciprocal regulation between T-bet and STAT6 in allergy remain unclear. To determine the reciprocal regulation in vivo, we investigated the phenotype of T-bet/STAT6 double-deficient (T-bet-/- STAT6-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice but not T-bet-/- mice or STAT6-/- mice spontaneously developed severe dermatitis. Not only eosinophils and mast cells but also CD4+ T cells infiltrated into the skin of T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells of T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice into SCID mice induced the accumulation of eosinophils and mast cells in the skin, while depletion of CD4+ T cells ameliorated the dermatitis in T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice. Comprehensive transcriptome analyses revealed that IL-9 expression was enhanced in T-bet-/- STAT6-/- CD4+ T cells. Indeed, IL-9 neutralization ameliorated the dermatitis in T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice. Importantly, T-bet-/- STAT6-/- CD4+ T cells expressed functional TSLP receptor and produced large amounts of IL-9 upon TSLP stimulation. These results indicate that T-bet and STAT6 suppress atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation, possibly by inhibiting TSLP-dependent IL-9 production in CD4+ T cells.", "Title": ["T-bet and STAT6 Coordinately Suppress the Development of IL-9-mediated Atopic Dermatitis-like Skin Inflammation in Mice"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL18480": "Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Total RNA of CD44+ CD4+ T cells in skin-draining LNs was isolated from WT mice, T-bet-/- mice, STAT6-/- mice, or T-bet-/- STAT6-/- mice and subjected to RNA-sequencing analysis."], "PubMedIDs": ["33068596"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33068596/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM4728388", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: wildtype", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728389", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: wildtype", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728390", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: T-bet-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728391", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: T-bet-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728392", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: STAT6-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728393", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: STAT6-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728394", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: T-bet-/- STAT6-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4728395", "TissueType": "CD44+ CD4+ T cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: BALB/cAJcl", "genotype: T-bet-/- STAT6-/-", "tissue: CD44+ CD4+ T cells"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 1500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE153760", "Summary": "Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, but its complex pathogenesis is only insufficiently understood, resulting in still limited treatment options. Objective: We sought to characterize AD on both transcriptomic and proteomic levels in humans. Methods: We used skin suction blistering, a painless and nonscarring procedure that can simultaneously sample skin cells and interstitial fluid. We then compared results with conventional biopsies. Results: Suction blistering captured epidermal and most immune cells equally well as biopsies, except for mast cells and nonmigratory CD163+ macrophages that were only present in biopsy isolates. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found comparable transcriptional profiles of key inflammatory pathways between blister and biopsy AD, but suction blistering was superior in cell-specific resolution for high-abundance transcripts (KRT1/KRT10, KRT16/KRT6A, S100A8/S100A9), which showed some background signals in biopsy isolates. Compared with healthy controls, we found characteristic upregulation of AD-typical cytokines such as IL13 and IL22 in Th2 and Th22 cells, respectively, but we also discovered these mediators in proliferating T cells and natural killer T cells, that also expressed the antimicrobial cytokine IL26. Overall, not T cells, but myeloid cells were most strongly enriched in AD, and we found dendritic cell (CLEC7A, amphiregulin/AREG, EREG) and macrophage products (CCL13) among the top upregulated proteins in AD blister fluid proteomic analyses. Conclusion: These data show that by using cutting-edge technology, suction blistering offers several advantages over conventional biopsies, including better transcriptomic resolution of skin cells, combined with proteomic information from interstitial fluid, unraveling novel inflammatory players that shape the cellular and proteomic microenvironment of AD.", "Title": ["Single-cell Transcriptomics Combined With Interstitial Fluid Proteomics Defines Cell Type-Specific Immune Regulation in Atopic Dermatitis"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL21290": "Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Comparison of skin cells obtained by skin suction blistering and conventional biopsy", "", ">>>Raw data are unvailable due to patient privacy concerns<<<"], "PubMedIDs": ["32344053", "33717163"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32344053/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33717163/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM4653855", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: 34,2", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653856", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: 44,6", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653857", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: 44,7", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653858", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: 5,5", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653859", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: 24,1", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653860", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: 28,1", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653861", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: 42,8", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653862", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: 46,5", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653863", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653864", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653865", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653866", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v2"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653867", "TissueType": "Skin Suction blister", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Suction blister", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653868", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM4653869", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "easi score: n.a.", "diagnosis: Healthy Control", "chemistry: Single Cell 3' v3"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 3000"], "StudyType": "scRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE147424", "Summary": "Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathogenesis, involving immune cell and epidermal abnormalities. Despite whole tissue biopsy studies that have advanced the mechanistic understanding of AD, single-cell-based molecular alterations are largely unknown. Objective: To construct a detailed, high-resolution atlas of cell populations, and to assess variability in cell composition and cell-specific gene expression in the skin of AD patients versus controls. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on skin biopsies from 5 patients with AD (4 lesional samples, 5 non-lesional samples) and 7 healthy control subjects, using 10x Genomics. Results: We created transcriptomic profiles for 39,042 AD (lesional and non-lesional) and healthy skin cells. Fibroblasts demonstrated a novel COL6A5+COL18A1+ subpopulation that was unique to lesional AD, and expressed CCL2 and CCL19 cytokines. A corresponding LAMP3+ dendritic cell (DC) population that expressed the CCL19 receptor CCR7 was also unique to AD lesions, illustrating a potential role for fibroblast signaling to immune cells. Lesional AD samples were characterized by expansion of inflammatory DCs (CD1A+FCER1A+) and tissue resident memory T-cells (CD69+CD103+). The frequencies of type 2 (IL13+)/type 22 (IL22+) T-cells were higher than type 1 (IFNG+) in lesional AD, while this ratio was diminished slightly in non-lesional AD and further in controls.

We sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of the redundant and distinct roles of IL-4 and IL-13 in type 2 inflammation and report dupilumab mechanisms of action. Methods: Using primary cell assays and a mouse model of house dust mite induced asthma, we compared IL-4 versus IL-13 versus IL-4Ra blockers. Results: Intranasal administration of either IL-4 or IL-13 confers an asthma-like phenotype in mice by inducing immune cell lung infiltration, including eosinophils, increasing cytokine/chemokine expression and mucus production, thus demonstrating redundant functions of these cytokines. We further teased out their respective contributions using human in vitro culture systems. Then, in a mouse asthma model by comparing in head to head studies, either IL-4 or IL-13 inhibition to dual IL-4/IL-13 inhibition, we demonstrate that blockade of both IL-4 and IL-13 is required to broadly block type 2 inflammation, which translates to protection from allergen-induced lung function impairment. Notably, only dual IL-4/IL-13 blockade prevented eosinophil infiltration into lung tissue without affecting circulating eosinophils, demonstrating that tissue, but not circulating eosinophils contribute to disease pathology.

"Purpose: To determine the transcriptional differences between skin from patients with atopic dermatitis and control skin obtained from the healthy margins of Mohs surgery patients Methods: 4 mm skin biopsies of skin from atopic dermatitis patients or deidentified healthy margin surgical tissue were obtained and stored in RNA Later (-80C). Whole tissue RNA was isolated from tissue processed with a bead homogenizer using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit. Following DNase treatment (TurboDNase, Invitrogen), ribosomal RNA was removed (Ribo-zero kit, Illumina). mRNA was then fragmented in buffer containing 40 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.2), 100 mM potassium acetate, and 30 mM magnesium acetate and heated to 94C for 150 s. mRNA was reverse transcribed to yield cDNA using SuperScript III RT enzyme (Invitrogen, per manufacturer\u2019s instructions) and random hexamers. A second strand reaction was performed to yield dscDNA. cDNA was blunt ended, had an A base added to the 30 ends, and then had Illumina sequencing adapters ligated to the ends. Ligated fragments were then amplified for 12 cycles using primers incorporating unique index tags. Fragments were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-3000 using single reads extending 50 bases. Samples were sequenced to an average depth of 32 million 1x50 reads on a HiSeq3000 (Illumina).

These DEGs included genes important in lipid metabolism and keratinization, consistent with the understanding of barrier dysfunction in atopic inflammation, as well as significant immunologic pathways in adaptive and innate immunity previously identified in the human AD transcriptome Conclusions: Our study reveals that the transcriptome of ADAM17 cKO mice capture a part of upregulated genes previously observed in human AD skin.", "Title": ["Next Generation Sequencing of  skin from wild-type and ADAM17 cKO (Sox9-Cre x ADAM17fl/fl) mice"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL17021": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Epidermal and whole skin mRNA profiles of 10-week-old WT and ADAM17 cKO mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicates."], "PubMedIDs": [], "PubMedURLs": [], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM2875765", "TissueType": "Skin WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875766", "TissueType": "Skin WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875767", "TissueType": "Skin WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875768", "TissueType": "Skin Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875769", "TissueType": "Skin Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875770", "TissueType": "Skin Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: Skin"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875771", "TissueType": "Epidermis WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875772", "TissueType": "Epidermis WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875773", "TissueType": "Epidermis WT", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: wild type", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875774", "TissueType": "Epidermis Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875775", "TissueType": "Epidermis Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2875776", "TissueType": "Epidermis Adam17 KO", "Characteristics": ["strain background: C57BL/6", "genotype/variation: ADAM17 cKO", "age: 10 weeks", "tissue: epidermis"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina HiSeq 2500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE102628", "Summary": "Previous transcriptome analyses confirmed the major role of immunological and skin barrier abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD). We here aimed at identifying novel pathogenic pathways involved in AD by comparing AD patients stratified for filaggrin (FLG) mutations not only to healthy donors but also to patients with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV). We applied single-molecule direct RNA-sequencing to analyze the whole transcriptome of nonlesional skin. Six hundred and one genes (478 up-regulated and 123 down-regulated by greater than 2-fold) were differentially expressed when all AD patients were compared to healthy donors. Expression of genes involved in RNA/protein synthesis, RNA splicing, and ATP synthesis was enhanced. Interestingly, genes involved in cell death, response to oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair and xenobiotic metabolism were largely enriched. Two hundred and thirty-seven genes (216 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated by greater than 2-fold) were altered in the skin of IV patients when compared to healthy donors. Remarkably, enhancement of xenobiotic metabolism was only detected in AD skin. Moreover, increased expression of genes encoding for keratinocyte cross-linking (SPRR2) and S100 proteins characterizes the skin of patients with AD flare when compared to patients without. We did not find significant differences in gene profiling between AD patients with and without FLG mutations.This work reveals new putative pathogenic pathways related to xenobiotic metabolisms involved in AD.", "Title": ["Transcriptional profiling unravels enhanced xenobiotic metabolism in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis but not with ichthyosis vulgaris"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20148": "AB 5500xl-W Genetic Analysis System (Homo sapiens)", "GPL23934": "Ion Torrent S5 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["29 samples, skin biopsies"], "PubMedIDs": ["28899689"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899689/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM2741987", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741988", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741989", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741990", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741991", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741992", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741993", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741994", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741995", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741996", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741997", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741998", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2741999", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742000", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742001", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742002", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742003", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742004", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742005", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742006", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742007", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742008", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742009", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: control (CO)", "mutation: WT"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742010", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742011", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742012", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742013", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: ichthyosis vulgaris (IV)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742014", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2742015", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["disease: atopic dermatitis (AD)", "mutation: FLG mutation"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["AB 5500xl-W Genetic Analysis System", "Ion Torrent S5"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE105035", "Summary": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a point mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene forming hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes in deoxygenated erythrocytes, triggering recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises and chronic hemolytic anemia. Reactivation of fetal Hb (HbF) expression ameliorates these symptoms of SCD. Nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2)\u2013like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that triggers cytoprotective and antioxidant pathways to limit oxidative damage and inflammation and increases HbF synthesis in CD34+ stem cell\u2013derived erythroid progenitors. We investigated the ability of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a small-molecule Nrf2 agonist, to activate \u03b3-globin transcription and enhance HbF in tissue culture, murine and primate models. DMF recruited Nrf2 to the \u03b3-globin promoters and the locus control region of the \u03b2-globin locus in erythroleukemia cells, elevated HbF in SCD donor\u2013derived erythroid progenitors, and reduced hypoxia-induced sickling. Chronic DMF administration in SCD mice induced HbF and increased Nrf2-dependent genes to detoxify heme and limit inflammation. This improved hematological parameters, reduced plasma-free Hb, and attenuated inflammatory markers. Chronic DMF administration to nonanemic primates increased \u03b3-globin mRNA in BM and HbF protein in red cells.

Despite evidence for pathogenic Th2 cells in the induction and propagation of allergic disorders, signals required for differentiation of such cells remain largely unknown. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that is expressed upon epithelial injury, dysfunction or infection and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. Although indirect regulation of Th2 differentiation via TSLP-stimulated dendritic cells well known, direct effects of TSLP on Th2 differentiation in vivo have not been rigorously analyzed. We show that TSLP may initiate Th2 response independent on IL-4 signal and increases sensitivity of CD4 cells to IL-4 stimulation inducing more robust expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by human and mouse CD4 cells. This more potent effector state appears to be stably programmed in memory Th2 cells. As part of molecular mechanism, we demonstrate that TSLP and IL-4 signals induce distinctive genome wide alterations in activating histone modification (H3K27Ac, H3K36Me3, and H3K4Me3).

"Summary": "Background: Imiquimod (IMQ) produces a cutaneous phenotype in mice frequently studied as an acute model of human psoriasis. Whether this phenotype depends on strain or sex has never been systematically investigated on a large scale. Such effects, however, could lead to conflicts among studies, while further impacting study outcomes and efforts to translate research findings. Methods: RNA-seq was used to evaluate the psoriasiform phenotype elicited by IMQ in both sexes of 7 mouse strains (C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, CD1, DBA/1J, FVB/NJ, 129X1/SvJ and MOLF/EiJ). Results: In most strains, IMQ altered gene expression in a manner consistent with human psoriasis, partly due to innate immune activation and decreased homeostatic gene expression. The IMQ response of MOLF males was aberrant, however, with decreased expression of differentiation-associated genes (elevated in other strains). Key aspects of the IMQ response differed between the two most commonly studied strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6). Compared with BALB/c, the C57BL/6 phenotype showed increased expression of genes associated with DNA replication, IL-17A activation and CD8+ T cells, but decreased expression of genes associated with interferon signaling and CD4+ T cells. Surprisingly, although IMQ-induced expression shifts mirrored psoriasis, correspondence was similar or better for other human skin diseases (e.g., eschars, acne, atopic dermatitis). For BALB/c, MOLF, and 129X1 strains, genes altered by IMQ corresponded better to those altered in human skin infections or wounds compared with those altered in psoriasis lesions. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate strain-dependent aspects of IMQ dermatitis that warrant consideration in planning and interpreting experimental studies. We have further shown that IMQ does not uniquely model psoriasis but in fact triggers a core set of pathways active in diverse skin diseases. These observations challenge the view of IMQ dermatitis as a mouse phenotype uniquely appropriate for studying psoriasis as opposed to other human skin conditions.", "Title": ["Imiquimod has strain-dependent effects in mice and does not uniquely model human psoriasis"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL11002": "Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["RNA-seq was used to investigate the psoriasiform phenotype that develops following topical IMQ treatment in male and female mice of 7 laboratory mouse strains (C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, CD1, DBA/1J, FVB/NJ, 129X1/SvJ and MOLF/EiJ).

prone to disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, i.e. eczema herpeticum (ADEH+). Biomarkers that identify ADEH+ are lacking. Objective: To search for novel ADEH+ gene signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: A RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach was applied to evaluate global transcriptional changes using PBMCs from ADEH+ and AD without a history of EH (ADEH-). Candidate genes were confirmed by qPCR or ELISA. Results: ADEH+ PBMCs had distinct changes to the transcriptome when compared to ADEH- PBMCs following HSV-1 stimulation: 792 genes were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (ANOVA), and 15 type I and type III interferon (IFN) genes were among the top 20 most down-regulated genes in ADEH+. We further validated that IFN-\u03b1 and IL-29 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in HSV-1 stimulated PBMCs from ADEH+ compared to ADEH- and normal. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated that the up-stream regulators of type I and type III IFNs, IRF3 and IRF7 was significantly inhibited in ADEH+ based on the down-regulation of their target genes. Furthermore, we found that gene expression of IRF3 and IRF7 were significantly decreased in HSV-1 stimulated PBMC from ADEH+ subjects. Conclusions: PBMCs from ADEH+ have a distinct immune response following HSV-1 exposure compared to ADEH- .
