Several cases of dermatomyositis (DM) associated with mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported.

The aim of this review is to analyse the sample of previously published case reports of DM following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination for common indicators of a possible immune pathomechanism.In this review, we summarised case reports of DM following mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. We considered this case report landscape as a cumulative sample (n\u2009=\u200932) and identified common clinical and molecular parameters in the intersection of case reports and statistically analysed the effect of these parameters on the development of DM.MDA-5 antibodies seem to play a role in the autoantibody signature after mRNA vaccination. MDA-5-positive DM is statistically more strongly associated with mRNA vaccination and interstitial lung disease/rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD/RP-ILD) than MDA-5-negative DM. MDA-5-positive DM seems not to be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, whereas MDA-5-negative DM is more strongly associated with malignancy.Our findings emphasize the potential role of innate antiviral signalling pathways in connecting DM to mRNA vaccination.

Its pathogenesis involves a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and immunological factors, with interferon pathways and specific gene upregulations playing crucial roles. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging, with particular emphasis on myositis-specific antibodies and characteristic muscle and skin changes. The clinical heterogeneity of DM, including variants such as clinically amyopathic DM and DM-associated interstitial lung disease, necessitates a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Current pharmacological treatments for DM include glucocorticoids, which remain the first-line therapy despite their long-term adverse effects. Immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil, are commonly used in combination with glucocorticoids to enhance efficacy and reduce steroid dependence. Biologics, such as rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin, have shown effectiveness in refractory cases. Emerging therapies, particularly Janus kinase inhibitors, offer promise for treatment-resistant DM, although they present significant safety concerns, including increased risks of infections and cardiovascular events. Despite significant advancements, managing DM remains challenging due to its rarity and variability. Future research should prioritize the development of precision medicine approaches tailored to individual genetic and pathological features.

Systemic corticosteroids are a cornerstone of therapy, and more recently intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; OCTAGAM\u00ae) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with DM. Both steroids and IVIG represent nonspecific anti-inflammatory therapy, and more targeted approaches are lacking. Transcriptomics has identified upregulation of interferon (IFN)-regulated genes as key features of both adult DM and juvenile DM (JDM). Accordingly, blocking IFN signalling through inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK) pathway represents a potential treatment option for DM. Placebo-controlled trial data assessing the use of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of DM are limited; as such, a systematic literature review was undertaken to assess the evidence of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of patients with DM. Terms related to DM and JAK inhibitors were searched using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions to identify peer-reviewed publications reporting patients with DM who were treated with a JAK inhibitor. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcome data were extracted. A total of 48 publications reporting 145 unique patients (adult DM, n=84; JDM, n=61) were identified. Among cases of adult DM, 61 of 84 (73%) had refractory skin disease at baseline, and all (61 of 61) reported improvement in cutaneous symptoms.

Muscle injuries can lead to severe disability. Skeletal muscle is characterized by an important regeneration capacity, which is possible due to the interaction between the myoblasts and immune cells. Neutrophils are fundamental as inducers of muscle damage and as promoters of the initial inflammatory response which eventually allows the muscle repair. The main functions of the neutrophils are phagocytosis, respiratory burst, degranulation, and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). An overactivation of neutrophils after muscle injuries may lead to an expansion of the initial damage and can hamper the successful muscle repair. The importance of neutrophils as inducers of muscle damage extends beyond acute muscle injury and recently, neutrophils have become more relevant as part of the immunopathogenesis of chronic muscle diseases like idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). This heterogeneous group of systemic autoimmune diseases is characterized by the presence of muscle inflammation with a variable amount of extramuscular features. In IIM, neutrophils have been found to have a role as biomarkers of disease activity, and their expansion in peripheral blood is related to certain clinical features like interstitial lung disease (ILD) and cancer. On the other hand, low density granulocytes (LDG) are a distinctive subtype of neutrophils characterized by an enhanced production of NETs. These cells along with the NETs have also been related to disease activity and certain clinical features like ILD, vasculopathy, calcinosis, dermatosis, and cutaneous ulcers. The role of NETs in the immunopathogenesis of IIM is supported by an enhanced production and deficient degradation of NETs that have been observed in patients with dermatomyositis and anti-synthetase syndrome. Finally, new interest has arisen in the study of other phenotypes of LDG with a phenotype corresponding to myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which were also found to be expanded in patients with IIM and were related to disease activity.

Five different clinical subphenotypes of IIM have been distinguished: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, antisynthetase syndrome, and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. Excess mortality and morbidity associated with IIM are largely attributed to comorbidities, particularly cancer. The risk of malignancy is not equally distributed among IIM groups and is particularly high among patients with dermatomyositis. The cancer risk peaks around 3\u2009years on either side of the IIM diagnosis and remains elevated even 10\u2009years after the onset of the disease. Lung, colorectal, and ovarian neoplasms typically arise before the onset of IIM, whereas melanoma, cervical, oropharyngeal, and nonmelanoma skin cancers usually develop after IIM diagnosis. Given the close temporal proximity between IIM diagnosis and the emergence of malignancy, it has been proposed that IIM could be a consequence rather than a cause of cancer, a process known as a paramalignant phenomenon. Thus, a separate group of IIMs related to paramalignant phenomenon has been distinguished, known as cancer-associated myositis (CAM). Although the relationship between IIM and cancer is widely recognized, the pathophysiology of CAM remains elusive. Given that genetic factors play a role in the development of IIM, dissection of the molecular mechanisms shared between IIM and cancer presents an opportunity to examine the role of autoimmunity in cancer development and progression.

Unraveling this mysterious connection is likely to provide deeper understanding regarding mechanisms governing the onset of both autoimmunity and cancer immunity, in addition to providing clinicians much needed guidance around whom and when to screen for occult malignancy. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and dermatomyositis are two diseases in which the association with internal malignancy is well-described and can be considered as models from which to gain important insights that likely have broader applicability. The past 15 years have witnessed a striking acceleration in understanding how these two diseases are related to cancer emergence-an important crack in this inscrutable armor has been the discovery and characterization of disease-specific autoantigens that are closely tied with risk of cancer emergence. The best-described examples of this are antibodies against anti-RNA polymerase III (anti-POL3) and transcription intermediary factor 1-gamma (anti-TIF1\u03b3). Patients with systemic sclerosis and cancer that are diagnosed within a short time interval of each other frequently have anti-POL3 antibodies. Antibodies against the minor spliceosome protein RNA-Binding Region Containing 3 (RNPC3) are also associated with increased cancer incidence in systemic sclerosis. Similarly, in the dermatomyositis spectrum, the majority of anti-TIF1\u03b3-associated cancers are detected around the time of DM onset (most often within 1 year). Antibodies against Nuclear Matrix Protein 2 are also potentially associated with increased cancer emergence in dermatomyositis. The systemic sclerosis/anti-POL3 connection with close cancer onset led to the first experiments directly supporting the concept that rheumatic disease may in fact be a manifestation of cancer. It is now clear that studying these diseases through the lens of autoantibodies can reveal relationships and insights that would otherwise remain obscured. Extending these studies, new findings show that antibodies against RNA polymerase I large subunit are associated with protection against short interval cancers in anti-POL3-positive systemic sclerosis patients. These insights highlight the fact that autoantigen discovery related to cancer emergence remains an important priority; such new tools will enable the testing of specific hypotheses regarding mechanisms governing disease emergence and development of effective anti-tumor responses. Autoantibody phenotype will likely play an important role in the development of cancer screening guidelines that are critically needed by clinicians taking care of these patients.

The underlying pathogenesis is characterized by a high level of uncertainty, and recent studies suggest diseases may have different immunopathological mechanisms. In polymyositis, components of the cellular immune system are involved, whereas in dermatomyositis, the pathogenesis is mainly mediated by the humoral immune response. The interstitial lung disease occurs in one-third of polymyositis and dermatomyositis patients associated with worse outcomes, showing an estimated excess mortality rate of around 40%. Lung involvement may also appear, such as a complication of muscle weakness, mainly represented by aspiration pneumonia or respiratory insufficiency. The clinical picture is characterized, in most cases, by progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough. In some cases, hemoptysis and chest pain are found. Onset can be acute, sub-acute, or chronic. Pulmonary involvement could be assessed by High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT), which may identify early manifestations of diseases. Moreover, Computed Tomography (CT) appearances can be highly variable depending on the positivity of myositis-specific autoantibodies. The most common pathological patterns include fibrotic and cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or organizing pneumonia; major findings observed on HRCT images are represented by consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and reticulations. Other findings include honeycombing, subpleural bands, and traction bronchiectasis. In patients having Anti-ARS Abs, HRCT features may develop with consolidations, ground glass opacities (GGOs), and reticular opacities in the peripheral portions; nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia mixed with organizing pneumonia have been reported as the most frequently encountered patterns. In patients with anti-MDA5 Abs, mixed or unclassifiable patterns are frequently observed at imaging. HRCT is a sensitive method that allows one not only to identify disease, but also to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect disease progression and/or complications; however, radiological findings are not specific.

It most commonly occurs in adults with preponderance in females, but pediatric occurrence is also possible. The risk of malignancy in adult patients with dermatomyositis was reported to be 4.66-fold higher compared to that in the general population. A significantly increased risk of malignancy was reported within the first 12 months following the diagnosis of dermatomyositis (standardized incidence ratio equaled 17). One of the characteristic laboratory findings associated with dermatomyositis is the presence of circulating autoantibodies which are classified into two subgroups: myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies. It was shown that specific types of antibodies might be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Current literature data indicate that the strongest correlation with malignant diseases was reported in anti-TIF1-\u03b3-positive patients who were at a 9.37-fold higher risk of cancer. A 3.68-fold increase in the risk of cancer was also reported among patients with anti-NXP2 antibodies. Malignant diseases were reported in 14-57% of patients with anti-SAE antibodies.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has major pulmonary involvement and is associated with increased mortality in PM/DM/CADM. The management of PM-/DM-/CADM-associated ILD (PM/DM/CADM-ILD) requires careful evaluation of the disease severity and clinical subtype, including the ILD forms (acute/subacute or chronic), because of the substantial heterogeneity of their clinical courses. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of myositis-specific autoantibodies' status, especially anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (ARS) antibodies, in order to evaluate the clinical phenotypes and treatment of choice for PM/DM/CADM-ILD. Because the presence of the anti-MDA5 antibody is a strong predictor of a worse prognosis, combination treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporin A (CsA)) is recommended for patients with anti-MDA5 antibody-positive DM/CADM-ILD. Rapidly progressive DM/CADM-ILD with the anti-MDA5 antibody is the most intractable condition, which requires immediate combined immunosuppressive therapy with GCs, CNIs, and intravenous cyclophosphamide. Additional salvage therapies (rituximab, tofacitinib, and plasma exchange) should be considered for patients with refractory ILD. Patients with anti-ARS antibody-positive ILD respond better to GC treatment, but with frequent recurrence; thus, GCs plus immunosuppressants (TAC, CsA, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil) are often needed in order to achieve favorable long-term disease control.

The development of ultrasound technology, including strain analysis, stress Echo and contrast-enhanced Echo, helps disclose early cardiac dysfunction more sensitively than conventional Echo. Cardiac magnetic resonance unveils silent, acute or chronic myocarditis in PM/DM and is used to monitor treatment efficacy due to its excellent tissue characterization. PET can be useful thanks to the appearance of new tracers that can eliminate the effects of glucose uptake by normal cardiomyocytes.

Hereditary RMD is associated with caveolin-3 or cavin-1 mutations. Recently we discovered anti-cavin 4 autoantibodies as a biomarker of immune-mediated RMD (iRMD), but the underlying disease-mechanisms are poorly understood. Transcriptomic studies were performed on muscle biopsies of 8 patients (5 males; 3 females; ages 26-to-80) with iRMD. Subsequent pathway analysis compared iRMD to human non-disease control and disease control (dermatomyositis) muscle samples. Transcriptomic studies demonstrated changes in key pathways of muscle contraction and development. All iRMD samples had significantly upregulated cavin-4 expression compared to controls, likely compensatory for autoantibody-mediated protein degradation. Proteins involved in muscle relaxation (including SERCA1, PMCA and PLN) were significantly increased in iRMD compared to controls. Comparison of iRMD to dermatomyositis transcriptomics demonstrated significant overlap in immune pathways, and the IL-6 signaling pathway was markedly increased in all iRMD patient muscle biopsies and increased in the majority of iRMD patients\u2019 serum. This study represents the first muscle transcriptomic analysis of iRMD patients and dissects underlying disease mechanisms. Increase of sarcolemmal and cellular calcium channels as well as PLN, an inhibitor of the SERCA pump for calcium into the sarcoplasm, likely alters the calcium dynamics in iRMD. These changes in crucial components of muscle relaxation may underlie rippling by altering calcium flux.

These genetic changes are partially reversed by JAK inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib, with baricitinib leading to greater genetic alteration than tofacitinib.

USP18 depletion induced muscle cell differentiation under nutrient-rich conditions independent of IFN-1 signalling. Downregulation of cell cycle gene network and sarcomeric protein networks, and dysregulation of myogenic (co-)transcription regulators were found in USP18-depleted differentiated cells. Sarcomeric integrity of USP18-depleted cells deteriorated during muscle cell maturation.

Studying the mechanism of action of apremilast in dermatomyositis by performing RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies before and after treatment. Methods: We enrolled 8 patients with recalcitrant dermatomyositis. Apremilast 30 mg orally twice daily was added to a stable treatment regimen of steroids and/or steroids sparing agents and patients were followed for 7 months. A CDASI, muscle score, dermatology life quality index (DLQI), and depression assessments were performed at baseline and regularly till month 7. Skin biopsies were performed at baseline and 3-months post-apremilast to study gene expression alterations. Results: Our ORR assessed at 3 months post apremilast was 87.5%. The response was maintained at 6 months with continued decrease in CDASI and improvement in DLQI. The mean decrease in CDASI was 12.9 points (p<0.05). Apremilast was well tolerated and without any grade 3 or higher adverse events using CTCAE version 5. RNA sequencing was performed on skin biopsies from 7 patients before and 3 months after apremilast. Out of 39,076 expressed genes, there were 195 whose expression changed \u22652-fold at P<0.01 (123 down- and 72 up-regulated), several genes are known JAK-STAT targets. Using GSEA analysis, we identified 13 pathways significantly downregulated by apremilast, notably STAT1, STAT3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, INF\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 pathways. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed JAK/STAT signaling inhibition at the protein level. Conclusions: Apremilast is a safe and efficacious add-on treatment in recalcitrant dermatomyositis with an overall response rate of 87.5%, and functions through downregulation of JAK/STAT signaling in

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA which regulate gene expression of target mRNAs. The aim of this study was to profile miRNA and mRNA in IIM and identify miRNA-mRNA relationships which may be relevant to disease. Materials and methods: mRNA and miRNA in whole blood samples from 7 polymyositis (PM), 7 dermatomyositis (DM), 5 inclusion body myositis (IBM) and 5 non-myositis controls was profiled using next generation RNA sequencing. Gene ontology and pathway analyses were performed using GOseq and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Dysregulation of miRNAs and opposite dysregulation of predicted target mRNAs in IIM subgroups was validated using RTqPCR and investigated by transfecting human skeletal muscle cells with miRNA mimic. Results Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that interferon signalling and anti-viral response pathways were upregulated in PM and DM compared to controls. An anti-Jo1 autoantibody positive subset of PM and DM (n=5) had more significant upregulation and predicted activation of interferon signalling and highlighted T-helper (Th1 and Th2) cell pathways. In miRNA profiling miR-96-5p was significantly upregulated in PM, DM and the anti-Jo1positive subset. RTqPCR replicated miR-96-5p upregulation and predicted mRNA target (ADK, CD28 and SLC4A10) downregulation. Transfection of a human skeletal muscle cell line with miR-96-5p mimic resulted in significant downregulation of ADK. Conclusion: MiRNA and mRNA profiling identified dysregulation of interferon signalling, anti-viral response and T-helper cell pathways, and indicates a possible role for miR-96-5p regulation of ADK in

viruses and bacteria. Identifying the causative pathogen as quickly as possible is crucial to initiate the most optimal therapy, as acute bacterial meningitis is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics, as opposed to enteroviral meningitis, which only requires supportive therapy. Clinical presentation is usually not sufficient to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis, thereby necessitating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis by PCR and/or time-consuming bacterial cultures. However, collecting CSF in children is not always feasible and a rather invasive procedure. Methods: In 12 Belgian hospitals, we obtained acute blood samples from children with signs of meningitis (49 viral and 7 bacterial cases). (aged between 3 months and 16 years). After pathogen confirmation on CSF, the patient was asked to give a convalescent sample after recovery. 3\u2019mRNA sequencing was performed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to create a host transcriptomic profile. Results: Enteroviral meningitis cases displayed the largest upregulated fold change enrichment in type I interferon production, response and signaling pathways. Patients with bacterial meningitis showed a significant upregulation of genes related to macrophage and neutrophil activation. We found several significantly DEGs between enteroviral and bacterial meningitis. Random forest classification showed that we were able to differentiate enteroviral from bacterial meningitis with an AUC of 0.982 on held-out samples. Conclusions: Enteroviral meningitis has an innate immunity signature with type 1 interferons as key players. Our classifier, based on blood host transcriptomic profiles of different meningitis cases, is a possible strong alternative for diagnosing enteroviral meningitis.", "Title": ["Diagnosing enterovirus meningitis via blood transcriptomics: an alternative for lumbar puncture?"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL18573": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Gene expression profiles of host blood can be used to differentiate between different types of meningitis.
