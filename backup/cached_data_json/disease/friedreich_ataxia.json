These repeat expansion disorders can have repeat units of different size and sequence that can be located in any part of the gene and, while the pathological consequences of the expansion can differ widely, there is evidence to suggest that the underlying mutational mechanism may be similar. In the case of HD, the expanded repeat unit is a CAG trinucleotide located in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Expansion results in neuronal cell death, particularly in the striatum. Emerging evidence suggests that somatic CAG expansion, specifically expansion occurring in the brain during the lifetime of an individual, contributes to an earlier disease onset and increased severity. In this review we will discuss mouse models of two non-CAG repeat expansion diseases, specifically the Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) and Friedreich ataxia (FRDA).

This can be amplified potentially through redox active iron deposits in oxidatively active organelles such as the mitochondrion. There are a number of disease states, including Friedreich's ataxia (FA) and sideroblastic anemia, where iron metabolism is dysregulated and leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation. Considering FA, which is due to the decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin, this iron accumulation does not occur within protective storage proteins such as mitochondrial ferritin. Instead, it forms unbound biomineral aggregates composed of high spin iron(III), phosphorous and sulfur, which probably contributes to the observed redox stress. There is also a dysregulated response to the ensuing redox assault, as the master regulator of oxidative stress, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), demonstrates marked down-regulation. The dysfunctional response of Nrf2 in FA is due to multiple mechanisms including: (1) up-regulation of Keap1 that is involved in Nrf2 degradation; (2) activation of the nuclear Nrf2 export/degradation machinery via glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (Gsk3\u03b2) signaling; and (3) inhibited nuclear translocation of Nrf2. More recently, increased microRNA (miRNA) 144 expression has been demonstrated to down-regulate Nrf2 in several disease states, including an animal model of FA. Other miRNAs have also demonstrated to be dysregulated upon frataxin depletion in vivo in humans and animal models of FA.

Individuals are cognitively normal, but display a loss of motor coordination and cardiac abnormalities. Many ultimately succumb to heart failure. Administration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors has shown promise in mitochondrial myopathy and rodent models of heart failure, including mice lacking frataxin in cardiomyocytes. We studied mice with systemic knockdown of frataxin (shFxn), which display motor deficits and early mortality with cardiac hypertrophy. Hearts in these mice do not \u201cfail\u201d per se but become hyperdynamic with small chamber sizes. Data from an ongoing natural history study indicate that hyperdynamic hearts are observed in young individuals with FRDA, suggesting that the mouse model could reflect early pathology. Administering nicotinamide mononucleotide or riboside to shFxn mice increases survival, modestly improves cardiac hypertrophy, and limits increases in ejection fraction. Mechanistically, most of the transcriptional and metabolic changes induced by frataxin knockdown are insensitive to NAD+ precursor administration, but glutathione levels are increased suggesting improved antioxidant capacity.

is a rare genetic disorder characterized by motor discoordination and predominant cerebellar involvement. It is caused by mutations leading to decreased transcription of frataxin (FXN), a gene encoding for a mitochondrial protein involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters and iron handling. Many advances have been achieved in understanding the pathophysiology of FRDA and the mechanisms whereby FXN deficiency causes cerebellar degeneration. However, the issue concerning the contribution of central nervous system-resident non-neuronal cells to the pathogenesis of FRDA is still poorly explored. In this work, we set out to verify if specific vulnerabilities of cerebellar microglia could be involved in the pathogenesis of FRDA. Methods Primary cerebellar microglia were obtained from the KIKO mouse model of FRDA. We analyzed their phenotype and functions by a multilayer study, encompassing morphological analysis, migration and phagocytosis assays, gene expression by RNA-seq, RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Mitochondria functionality was evaluated by flow cytometry and real-time metabolic analysis. We assessed the effect of FRDA microglia on cell viability and neurite length in primary neurons. We analyzed in vivo microglia phenotype in the cerebellum of KIKO miceduring an early developmental stage by means of morphology analysis, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Results We demonstrated that FRDA microglia exhibit traceable morphological, transcriptional and functional changes, particularly regarding inflammatory pathways and mitochondria functionality. In addition, we found that FRDA microglia impair neuron survival and neurite length in vitro. Finally, we showed that cerebellar microglia in vivo exhibit dysregulations at early postnatal age of FRDA mice. Conclusions These results indicate that FRDA microglia display aberrant features and may participate in neuron dysfunction, evidencing a non-cell-autonomous mechanism in FRDA. Therefore, microglia targeting could be a valuable strategy in ameliorating cerebellar degeneration in the disease.", "Title": ["Loss of homeostatic functions in microglia from a murine model of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL24247": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Gene expression analysis of primary microglia from cerebellum of KIKO (B6.Cg-Fxntm1MknFxntm1Pand/J ) and control WT (C57BL/6) mice.

FXN is a mitochondrial protein critical for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and deficiency impairs mitochondrial electron transport chain functions and iron homeostasis within the organelle. Currently, there is no effective treatment for FRDA. We have previously demonstrated that a single infusion of wild-type hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) resulted in the prevention of the neurologic and cardiac complications of FRDA in YG8R mice, and the rescue was mediated by FXN transfer from tissue engrafted HSPC-derived microglia/macrophages to diseased neurons/myocytes. For a future clinical translation of this approach, we developed an autologous stem cell transplantation approach using CRISPR/Cas9 for the excision of the GAA repeats in FRDA patients\u2019 CD34+ HSPCs; this strategy leading to increased FXN expression and improved mitochondrial functions in the cells. The aim of the current study is to validate the efficiency and safety of our gene editing approach in a disease-relevant model. To this end, we generated a cohort of FRDA patient-derived iPSCs and isogenic lines that were gene edited with our CRISPR/Cas9 approach. FRDA neurons generated from these iPSCs displayed characteristic apoptotic and mitochondrial phenotype of the disease, such as non-homogenous microtubule staining in neurites, increased caspase-3 expression, mitochondrial superoxide levels, mitochondrial fragmentation, and partial degradation of the cristae compared to healthy controls. These defects were fully prevented in the gene edited neurons. RNASeq analysis of FRDA and gene edited neurons demonstrated striking improvement in gene clusters associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the isogenic lines. These results were validated by molecular and functional studies, and gene edited neurons demonstrated improved ER-calcium release, normalization of ER stress response gene, XBP-1, and significantly increased ER-mitochondrial contacts that are critical for functional homeostasis of both organelles, as compared to FRDA neurons. Ultrastructural analysis for these contact sites displayed severe structural damage to the ER in FRDA neurons, that was undetected in gene edited neurons. Taken together, these results represent a novel finding for disease pathogenesis showing dramatic ER structural damage and function in FRDA. In addition, these results validate the efficacy profile of our FXN gene editing approach, in a disease relevant model improving mitochondrial and cellular, and supporting our approach as an effective

(FRDA) is a recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia, dyscoordination, and loss of vision. The variable length of the pathogenic GAA triplet repeat expansion in the FXN gene in part explains Inter-individual variability in severity of disease. The GAA repeat expansion leads to epigenetic silencing of FXN; therefore, variability in properties of epigenetic effector proteins could also regulate the severity of FRDA. In an exploratory analysis, DNA from 88 FRDA patients was analyzed to determine if any of 5 non-synonymous SNPs in HDACs/ SIRTs predicted FRDA disease severity. Results suggested the need for a full analysis (569 FRDA patients) at the rs352493 locus in SIRT6 (S46N SNP). Disease features were compared between patients with the common N46 SIRT6 variant and the less common S46 variant. Biochemical properties of SIRT6 were compared between S46 and N46. Linear regression of the exploratory cohort suggested a SNP (rs352493) in SIRT6 predicted neurologic severity. In follow up analysis, the genotype of SIRT6 at the locus rs352493 predicted disease features of FRDA. Patients with the S46 SIRT6 variant performed better on measures of neurological and visual function over time when compared to the more common N46 SIRT6 variant.

We found that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by \u223c1.5-fold in the reporter cell line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is important in the regulation of FXN expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.", "Title": ["Inhibition of the SUV4-20 H1 histone methyltransferase increases frataxin expression in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia patient cells"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20301": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["24 samples derived from two cell lines; a Friedrich's ataxia cell line (GM04078) and a healthy control line (GM03440).

Herein, we generate dorsal root ganglia organoids (DRGOs) by in vitro differentiation of human iPSCs. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing show that DRGOs present a close transcriptional signature with native DRGs and display the main peripheral sensory neuronal and glial cell subtypes. Furthermore, when co-cultured with human intrafusal muscle fibers, DRGO sensory neurons contact their peripheral targets and reconstitute the muscle spindle proprioceptive receptors. FRDA DRGOs recapitulate key molecular and cellular deficits of the disease that are extensively rescued only when the entire FXN intron 1 is removed and not with the excision of merely the expanded GAA tract.

Conditional knockout of Ctcf in endothelial progenitors and their descendants affected embryonic growth, and caused lethality at embryonic day 10.5 owing to defective yolk sac and placental vascular development. Analysis of global gene expression revealed Frataxin (Fxn), the gene mutated in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (FRDA), as the most strongly downregulated gene in Ctcfdeficient placental endothelial cells.
