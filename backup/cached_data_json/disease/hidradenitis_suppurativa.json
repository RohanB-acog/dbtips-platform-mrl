{"/disease-profile/details/": {"data": {"diseases": {"id": "EFO_1000710", "name": "hidradenitis suppurativa", "description": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder primarily affecting areas rich in apocrine glands, such as the axillae and groin, and is characterized by follicular occlusion, leading to painful nodules and abscesses. The pathophysiology involves a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that trigger inflammation and immune responses, resulting in the formation of lesions, sinus tracts, and scarring. Clinically, patients experience significant pain, purulent discharge, and reduced quality of life due to the recurrent nature of the disease. There remains a substantial unmet need for more effective treatments; currently approved therapies have variable efficacy, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic strategies that can better address the underlying mechanisms of HS.", "synonyms": [{"relation": "hasExactSynonym", "terms": ["HS", "hidradenitis suppurativa", "ectopic acne", "pyoderma fistulans significa", "acne inversa", "Acne inversa, familial", "hidradenitis", "verneuil disease", "fox den disease"]}, {"relation": "hasNarrowSynonym", "terms": ["acne inversa, familial"]}]}}}, "/evidence/network-biology/": {"results": []}, "/disease-profile/ontology/": {"data": [{"id": "MONDO_0024516", "parentIds": ["EFO_1000710"], "name": "familial acne inversa", "nodeType": "child"}, {"id": "EFO_1000710", "parentIds": ["MONDO_0002260"], "name": "hidradenitis suppurativa", "nodeType": "anchor"}, {"id": "MONDO_0002260", "parentIds": ["EFO_1002046"], "name": "hidradenitis", "nodeType": "ancestor"}, {"id": "EFO_0000701", "parentIds": ["EFO_0010285"], "name": "skin disease", "nodeType": "ancestor"}, {"id": "EFO_0010285", "parentIds": [], "name": "integumentary system disease", "nodeType": "ancestor"}, {"id": "EFO_1000772", "parentIds": ["EFO_0000701"], "name": "sweat gland disease", "nodeType": "ancestor"}, {"id": "EFO_1002046", "parentIds": ["EFO_1000772"], "name": "apocrine sweat gland disease", "nodeType": "ancestor"}]}}
