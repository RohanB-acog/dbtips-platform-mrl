Although CDI disproportionately affects people with IBD, patients with IBD are typically excluded from CDI clinical trials creating a knowledge gap in the diagnosis and management of these 2 diseases. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CDI in patients with IBD. Distinguishing CDI from C. difficile colonization in the setting of an IBD exacerbation is important to avoid treatment delays.

Regardless of a diagnosis of CDI, the presence of C. difficile in a patient with IBD should prompt a disease assessment of the underlying IBD. Microbiota-based therapies and bezlotoxumab seem to be effective in preventing CDI recurrence in patients with IBD. Patients with IBD should be considered at high risk of CDI recurrence and evaluated for a preventative strategy when diagnosed with CDI.

Consequently, they are considered promising adjunctive therapies for IBD. Recent studies indicate that postbiotics offer distinctive advantages, including spanning clinical (safe origin), technological (easy for storage and transportation) and economic (reduced production costs) dimensions, rendering them suitable for widespread applications in functional food/pharmaceutical. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the definition, classification and applications of postbiotics, with an emphasis on their biological activity in both the prevention and treatment of IBD. \u00a9 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.", "Year": "2025", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39007163/", "Qualifers": ["diet therapy", "immunology", "microbiology", "prevention & control"]}, {"PMID": "39870972", "Title": "Role of the gut microbiome in psychological symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel diseases.", "Abstract": "The brain-gut axis constitutes the basis for the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract driven by neural, hormonal, metabolic, immunological, and microbial signals.

As one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, CD's pathogenesis is closely linked with the intestinal microbiota. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained attention as a potential treatment for CD, with the effective reestablishment of intestinal microecology considered a crucial mechanism of FMT therapy. This article synthesizes the findings of population-based cohort studies to enhance our understanding of gut microbial characteristics in patients with CD. It delves into the roles of \"beneficial\" and \"pathogenic\" bacteria in CD's development. This article systematically reviews and compares data on clinical response rates, remission rates, adverse events, and shifts in bacterial microbiota. Among these studies, gut microbiome analysis was conducted in only 7, and a single study examined the metabolome. Overall, FMT has demonstrated a partial restoration of typical CD-associated microbiological alterations, leading to increased \u03b1-diversity in responders and a moderate shift in patient microbiota toward the donor profile. Several factors, including donor selection, delivery route, microbial state (fresh or frozen), and recipient condition, are identified as pivotal in influencing FMT's effectiveness. Future prospective clinical studies with larger patient cohorts and improved methodologies are imperative. In addition, standardization of FMT procedures, coupled with advanced genomic techniques such as macroproteomics and culture genomics, is necessary.

Neutrophils play a central role in IBD by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) -DNA-based structures with cytotoxic proteins-that contribute to mucosal damage and inflammation. Recent studies linking ROS production, DNA repair, and NET formation have identified NETs as potential therapeutic targets, with preclinical models showing positive outcomes from NET inhibition. Innovative oral drug delivery systems designed to target gut inflammation directly-without systemic absorption-could improve treatment precision and reduce side effects. Advanced formulations utilize properties such as particle size, surface modifications, and ROS-triggered release to selectively target the distal ileum and colon. A dual strategy that combines a deeper understanding of IBD pathophysiology to identify inflammation-related therapeutic targets with advanced drug delivery systems may offer significant promise.

Enterohepatic fistulas, a rare but significant complication, are scarcely reported. This article presents the case of a hepatic abscess due to an enterohepatic fistula in a patient with long-term Crohn disease and reviews the existing literature on this phenomenon. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old female patient with a known history of Crohn disease and previous ileocolic resection due to enteroenteric fistulas presented to our Emergency Department with right-sided abdominal pain persisting for 10 days. Diagnostic investigations, including imaging, revealed an enterohepatic fistula with a 3-4 cm hepatic abscess in segment V of the liver. Initial management involved conservative treatment with radiological drainage and antibiotics, leading to the patient's discharge. An elective laparotomy was scheduled 1 month later. The patient underwent resection of the ileocolic anastomosis with ileotransverse re-anastomosis and catheter removal. Postoperative management included treatment for paralytic ileus. She was discharged in good condition on postoperative day 11. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the range of complications that can occur in patients with Crohn disease and presents the rare association between Crohn disease and enterohepatic fistula and abscess formation. Only 2 other case reports of enterohepatic fistula due to Crohn disease exist in the literature.

Both inflammation and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier are key factors in IBD pathogenesis. Substantial evidence has revealed a significant association between aberrant immune responses and impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD pathogenesis. The components of the intestinal epithelium, particularly goblet cells and Paneth cells, are crucial to gut homeostasis, as they secrete mucin, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and cytokines. Furthermore, impairment of epithelial integrity, which is regulated by tight junctions, is a hallmark of IBD pathology. While common treatments for IBD, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, target various signaling pathways with varying efficacies, therapeutic approaches focused on mucosal and epithelial barrier healing have been largely neglected. Moreover, high costs, side effects, and insufficient or inconsistent therapeutic outcomes remain major drawbacks of conventional anti-IBD drugs. Recent studies on epithelial barrier regeneration and permeability reduction have introduced promising therapeutic targets, including farnesoid\u00a0X\u00a0receptor (FXR), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) interaction, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and insulin receptor (INSR).

Composed of specialized cells, this epithelial monolayer has an exceptional turnover rate. Differentiated epithelial cells are released into the intestinal lumen within a few days, at the villus tip, a process that requires strict regulation. Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier increases the intestinal permeability and paves the way for luminal antigens to pass into the intestinal serosa. Stem cells at the bottom of Lieberk\u00fchn crypts provide a constant supply of mature epithelial cells. Differentiated intestinal epithelial cells exhibit a diverse array of mechanisms that enable communication with surrounding cells, fortification against microorganisms, and orchestration of nutrient absorption and hormonal balance. Furthermore, tight junctions regulate paracellular permeability properties, and their disruption can lead to an impairment of the intestinal barrier, allowing inflammation to develop or further progress. Intestinal epithelial cells provide a communication platform through which they maintain homeostasis with a spectrum of entities including immune cells, neuronal cells, and connective tissue cells. This homeostasis can be disrupted in disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease show an impaired gut barrier, dysregulated cellular communication, and aberrant proliferation and\u00a0demise of cells.

As IBD is a multifactorial inflammation of the intestinal tract, a single-target approach is unlikely to solve this problem, necessitating an alternative strategy that addresses its variability. One approach often overlooked by the pharmaceutically driven therapeutic options is to\u00a0address the impact of environmental factors. This is somewhat surprising considering that IBD is increasingly viewed as a condition heavily influenced by such factors, including diet, stress, and environmental pollution-often referred to as the \"Western lifestyle\". In IBD, intestinal responses result from a complex interplay among the genetic background of the patient, molecules, cells, and the local inflammatory microenvironment where danger- and microbe-associated molecular patterns (D/MAMPs) provide an adjuvant-rich environment. Through activating DAMP receptors, this array of pro-inflammatory factors can stimulate, for example, the NLRP3 inflammasome-a major amplifier of the inflammatory response in IBD, and various immune cells via non-specific bystander activation of myeloid cells (e.g., macrophages) and lymphocytes (e.g., tissue-resident memory T cells). Current single-target biological treatment approaches can dampen the immune response, but without reducing exposure to environmental factors of IBD, e.g., by changing diet (reducing ultra-processed foods), the adjuvant-rich landscape is never resolved and continues to drive intestinal mucosal dysregulation. Thus, such treatment approaches are not enough to put out the inflammatory fire. The resultant smoldering, low-grade inflammation diminishes physiological resilience of the intestinal (micro)environment, perpetuating the state of chronic disease. Therefore, our hypothesis posits that successful interventions for IBD must address the complexity of the disease by simultaneously targeting all modifiable aspects: innate immunity cytokines and microbiota, adaptive immunity cells and cytokines, and factors that relate to the (micro)environment. Thus the disease can be comprehensively treated across the nano-, meso-, and microscales, rather than with a focus on single targets.

The prevalence of IBD is increasing worldwide, in both industrialized and developing countries, making IBD a global health problem that seriously affects quality of life. In 2019, there were approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD worldwide. Such a large number of patients entails significant healthcare costs. In the treatment of patients with IBD, the current therapeutic target is mucosal healing, as intestinal inflammation often persists despite resolution of abdominal symptoms. Treatment strategies include amino salicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies that focus on reducing intestinal mucosal inflammation, inducing and prolonging disease remission, and treating complications. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines also indicate that nutritional therapies may be considered in addition to other therapies. However, current therapeutic approaches are not fully effective and are associated with various limitations, such as drug resistance, variable efficacy, and side effects. As the chronic inflammation that accompanies IBD is characterized by infiltration of a variety of immune cells and increased expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-\u03b3, new therapeutic approaches are mainly targeting immune pathways. Interleukins are one of the molecular targets in IBD therapy. Interleukins and related cytokines serve as a means of communication for innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as nonimmune cells and tissues. These cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis and course of IBD, making them promising targets for current and future therapies.

Short-chain fatty acids like butyrate demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties, enhancing regulatory T cell function, gut barrier integrity, and epigenetic regulation, making them promising therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. Conversely, saturated fatty acids promote inflammation by disrupting gut homeostasis, triggering oxidative stress, and impairing immune regulation.

These innovative approaches, supported by the availability of big data and large volumes of digital medical datasets, hold promise in better understanding the natural histories, predictors of disease development, severity, complications and treatment outcomes in complex diseases, providing decision support to doctors, and promising to bring us closer to the realization of the \"precision medicine\" paradigm. This review aims to provide an overview of current IBD omics based on both individual (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics) and multi-omics levels, highlighting how AI can facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data to summarize our current understanding of the disease and to identify current gaps in knowledge to inform upcoming research in this field.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39215755/", "Qualifers": ["genetics", "immunology", "microbiology", "pathology"]}, {"PMID": "38837416", "Title": "Bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review of longitudinal studies with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.", "Abstract": "The bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with temporal directionality remain inconclusive.

The process of long-term fibrosis initiates with tissue hypofunction and progressively culminates in the ultimate manifestation of organ failure. Intestinal fibrosis is a significant complication of Crohn's disease (CD) that can result in persistent luminal narrowing and strictures, which are difficult to reverse. In recent years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal fibrosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Significant progress has been achieved in the fields of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of intestinal fibrosis in the last few years. A significant amount of research has also been conducted in the field of biomarkers for the prediction or detection of intestinal fibrosis, including novel cross-sectional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Molecular imaging represents a promising biomedical approach that enables the non-invasive visualization of cellular and subcellular processes. Molecular imaging has the potential to be employed for early detection, disease staging, and prognostication in addition to assessing disease activity and treatment response in IBD.

Gut microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC via multiple mechanisms, including the release of reactive oxygen species and genotoxins, and induction of inflammation, as well as activation of the immune response. Gut microbiota can enhance their carcinogenic and proinflammatory properties by organising into biofilms, potentially making them more resistant to the host's immune system and to antibiotics. Colonic biofilms have the capacity to invade colonic tissue and accelerate tumorigenesis in tumour-prone models of mice. In the context of IBD, the prevalence of biofilms has been estimated to be up to 95%. Although the relationship between chronic inflammation and molecular mediators that contribute to IBD-associated CRC is well established, the role of gut microbiota and biofilms in this sequence is not fully understood. Because CRC can still arise in the absence of histological inflammation, there is a growing interest in identifying chemopreventive agents against IBD-associated CRC. Commonly used in the treatment of UC, 5-aminosalicylates have antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties that might have a role in the chemoprevention of CRC via the inhibition or modulation of carcinogenic gut microbiota and potentially of biofilm formation. Whether biologics and other IBD-targeted therapies can decrease the progression towards dysplasia and CRC, via mechanisms independent of inflammation, is still unknown.

In recent years, the development and regulatory approval of various immunotherapies, both biological agents and small molecules, that target specific pathways of the IBD-associated inflammatory cascade have revolutionized the treatment of IBD. Small molecules offer the advantages of oral administration and short wash-out times. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive metabolite of ceramide, which exerts its functions after binding to five G-protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-S1PR5). Concerning IBD, S1P participates in the egress of lymphocytes from the secondary lymphoid tissue and their re-circulation to sites of inflammation, mainly through S1PR1 binding. In addition, this system facilitates the differentiation of T-helper cells towards proinflammatory immunophenotypes. Recently, S1P modulators have offered a valuable addition to the IBD treatment armamentarium. They exert their anti-inflammatory function via sequestration of T cell subsets in the lymphoid tissues and prevention of gut homing. In this review, we revisit the role of the S1P/S1PR axis in the pathogenesis of IBD and discuss efficacy and safety data from clinical trials and real-world reports on the two S1PR modulators, ozanimod and etrasimod, that are currently approved for IBD treatment, and comment on their potential positioning in the IBD day-to-day management.

These changes can impair postoperative recovery, influence metabolic functions, and predispose patients to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies have shown an increased risk of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), in patients following gastrectomy and bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). For instance, patients undergoing RYGB have a higher hazard ratio for developing CD, while SG patients show an increased risk for UC. The surgical alteration of the gastrointestinal tract promotes dysbiosis, with a significant increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial microbial populations. This dysbiosis can impair the intestinal mucosal barrier and promote systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms behind these changes and their clinical implications is essential for developing effective postoperative management strategies. Probiotics and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have shown promise in mitigating these adverse effects, improving gut microbiota balance, and enhancing patient outcomes.

However, the role of the microbiome (gut, skin, and blood) in the context of IBD and various follicular disorders remains underexplored. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate the relationship between follicular skin disorders, IBD, and the microbiome. Of the sixteen included studies, four evaluated the impact of diet on the microbiome in HS patients, highlighting a possible link between gut dysbiosis and yeast-exclusion diets. Ten studies explored bacterial colonization and HS severity with specific gut and skin microbiota, including Enterococcus and Veillonella. Two studies reported on immunological or serological biomarkers in HS patients with autoinflammatory disease, including IBD, and identified common markers including elevated cytokines and T-lymphocytes. Six studies investigated HS and IBD patients concurrently. Our systematic literature review highlights the complex interplay between the human microbiome, IBD, and follicular disorders with a particular focus on HS. The results indicate that dietary modifications hold promise as a therapeutic intervention to mitigate the burden of HS and IBD.

The etiology and pathogenesis are related to genetic susceptibility, intestinal microbiota, dysbiosis, immunological abnormalities and environmental factors (tobacco use, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives and diet). Diet may play a key role in the development and prevention of CD. Dietary patterns with high inflammatory potential (high intake of saturated fat, sugars, proteins, salt, as well as low consumption of fruits and vegetables) are associated with a higher risk of CD, while the consumption of a healthy diet, together with the practice of Exercise is a protective factor against relapses in IBD and reduces the risk of CD. Regarding dietary components, the consumption of fiber, as well as dietary polyphenols, has been related to the maintenance of the intestinal barrier by preventing erosion of the mucosal layer. \u03c9-3 fatty acids, in addition to their anti-inflammatory activity, promote the balance of the intestinal microbiota and their supplementation reduces postoperative complications and accelerates recovery in patients with CD.

For patients refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factors, treatment with anti-integrins, anti-interleukins, and small molecules is being evaluated. Mesenchymal stem cells, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and exclusive enteral nutrition have also been investigated as adjunct therapies. Despite the expansion of the medical armamentarium, a large proportion of the patients require surgical interventions.

Neutrophils, as the earliest immune cells to arrive at inflamed tissues, play a dual role in the onset and progression of mucosal inflammation in IBD. Most of these cells specifically express CD177, a molecule increasingly recognized for its critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Under IBD-related inflammatory stimuli, CD177 is highly expressed on neutrophils and promotes their migration. CD177\u2009+\u2009neutrophils activate bactericidal and barrier-protective functions at IBD mucosal inflammation sites and regulate the release of inflammatory mediators highly correlated with the severity of inflammation in IBD patients, thus playing a dual role. However, mitigating the detrimental effects of neutrophils in inflammatory bowel disease remains a challenge. Based on these data, we have summarized recent articles on the role of neutrophils in intestinal inflammation, with a particular emphasis on CD177, which mediates the recruitment, transepithelial migration, and activation of neutrophils, as well as their functional consequences.

To summarize, many physicians still over rely on a definitive histological diagnosis before starting treatment and do not fully establish disease extent such as perianal and proximal gastrointestinal involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) or extent of involvement in ulcerative colitis (UC). It is also essential to actively look for evidence of extra-intestinal manifestations, which may influence choice of therapy.

Acute severe UC remains a life-threatening condition and delay in starting rescue therapy after inadequate response to intravenous steroids is still common. Anti-tumor necrosis factors should be considered first line in all cases of complex perianal fistulizing CD.

The complex pathophysiological mechanisms of IBD include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and abnormal immune response of the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota forms a metabolic organ that contributes to human health by performing various physiological functions. The development of IBD is closely linked to the imbalance of gut microbiota. In IBD patients, this imbalance is mainly characterized by an increased abundance of pro-inflammatory microorganisms, specifically enteropathogenic bacteria. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that can be initiated by microbial infection or host factors. It occurs mostly after intracellular infection with bacteria or pathogens. Other than cell death, its primary effect is to release inflammatory mediators that trigger an inflammatory response in the host. Pyroptosis is an important component of innate immunity and can protect against intracellular risk factors via the inflammatory response. However, excessive activation can cause disease. Previous studies of IBD have indicated a complex relationship between gut microbiota and pyroptosis. Some enteropathogenic bacteria can activate the host's immune system to clear infected cells. This inhibits the proliferation of enteropathogenic bacteria by inducing pyroptosis and restoring the balance of gut microbiota. However, the initial inflammatory response and damage to the integrity of the intestinal barrier are crucial factors that elicit the onset of IBD and favor its progression.

For this to occur, it is imperative not only to use biosimilars in na\u00efve patients but also to switch to biosimilars in those patients who have started therapy with reference biologics. At present, randomized and observational studies have demonstrated effectiveness and safety results in recommending a single switch between a reference product and a biosimilar, and vice versa.

Their destructive effects may contribute to the disease's initiation and propagation, as they damage the gut lining and activate inflammatory signaling pathways, further exacerbating the inflammation. Oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and serum-free thiols (R-SH), can be measured in the blood and stool of patients with IBD.

These children with VEO-IBD are usually present with more severe disease than older children and adults. VEO-IBD is associated with monogenic defect. The thought of a monogenic cause of VEO-IBD was first confirmed by the detection of mutations of interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor genes that cause impaired IL-10 signaling. Monogenic IBD possesses significant concern because it usually presents with refractory to conventional IBD treatment or fistulous Crohn's disease, so early treatment with biologics or an alternative approach such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) might be looked-for.

Advances in endoscopic technology allow for improved visualization of dysplasia, which has led to widespread adoption of dye-spray chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsy.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38677829/", "Qualifers": ["complications", "diagnosis"]}, {"PMID": "38615278", "Title": "Comparison of different sources of mesenchymal stem cells: focus on inflammatory bowel disease.", "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses a significant challenge in modern medicine, with conventional treatments limited by efficacy and associated side effects, necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as promising candidates for IBD treatment due to their immunomodulatory properties and regenerative potential. This thesis aims to explore and compare various sources of MSC and evaluate their efficacy in treating IBD. This study comprehensively analyses MSC derived from multiple sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and other potential reservoirs. Core elements of this investigation include assessing differences in cell acquisition, immunomodulatory effects, and differentiation capabilities among these MSC sources, as well as comparing their clinical trial outcomes in IBD patients to their therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Through meticulous evaluation and comparative analysis, this thesis aims to elucidate disparities in the efficacy of different MSC sources for IBD treatment, thereby identifying the most promising therapeutic applications. The findings of this study are intended to advance our understanding of MSC biology and offer valuable insights for selecting the most effective MSC sources for personalized IBD therapy. Ultimately, this research endeavor will optimise therapeutic strategies for managing inflammatory bowel disease through the utilization of MSC.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Comparative Study"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38615278/", "Qualifers": ["therapy"]}, {"PMID": "38608876", "Title": "Recent progress on engineered micro/nanomaterials mediated modulation of gut microbiota for treating inflammatory bowel disease.", "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic recurrent inflammation disease that mainly includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Currently, the treatments for IBD remain highly challenging, with clinical treatment drugs showing limited efficacy and adverse side effects. Thus, developing drug candidates with comprehensive therapeutic effects, high efficiency, and low toxicity is urgently needed. Recently, micro/nanomaterials have attracted considerable interest because of their bioavailability, multitarget and efficient effects on IBD. In addition, gut modulation plays a substantial role in restoring intestinal homeostasis. Therefore, efficient microbiota-based strategies modulating gut microenvironment have great potential in remarkably treating IBD. With the development of micro- and nanomaterials for the treatment of IBD and more in-depth studies of their therapeutic mechanisms, it has been found that these treatments also have a tendency to positively regulate the intestinal flora, resulting in an increase in the beneficial flora and a decrease in the level of pathogenic bacteria, thus regulating the composition of the intestinal flora to a normal state. In this review, we first present the interactions among the immune system, intestinal barrier, and gut microbiome. In addition, recent advances in administration routes and methods that positively arouse the regulation of intestinal flora for IBD using probiotics, prebiotics, and redox-active micro/nanomaterials have been reviewed.

This review aims to provide a concise practical guide to small molecule drug interactions for the use of IBD physicians. It starts with a brief overview of the main metabolizing enzymes and transporters involved in drug interactions and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approach to determining drug-interaction hazard thresholds. It is then followed by a more detailed review of the pharmacokinetics of five novel small molecules approved in IBD: Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib, Filgotinib, Ozanimod, and Etrasimod, including their known interactions and specific warnings. This review will also inform readers on challenges in determining the actual magnitude of interactions and their clinical relevance, including the arbitrary nature of some hazard thresholds, the inference of the impact on metabolizing enzymes and transporters from single-drug assays which may not reflect poly-pharmaceutical regimens, and other challenges in this field which the IBD physician needs to be cognizant of. In practice, before administering a small molecule drug, it is advisable to evaluate any potential interactions with other medications the patient is receiving.

Nutrition therapy for IBD has been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, promote healing, and alleviate symptoms, as well as improve patients' nutrition status. Although the mechanisms of action of most nutrition therapies for IBD are not well understood, the diets are theorized to eliminate triggers for gut dysbiosis and mucosal immune dysfunction associated with the typical Western diet. Exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's disease exclusion diet are increasingly being used as the primary treatment modality for the induction of remission and/or maintenance therapy in children, and in some adults, with CD. Several other diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, anti-inflammatory diet for IBD, and diets excluding gluten, FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols), lactose, or other compounds, may be helpful in symptom management in both CD and UC, though evidence for biochemical efficacy is limited.

Each person's gut microbiota has a unique makeup. The gut microbiota is well acknowledged to have a part in the local as well as systemic inflammation that underlies a number of inflammatory disorders (e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease).The gut microbiota's metabolic products, such as short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, and acetate) inhibit inflammation by preventing immune system cells like macrophages and neutrophils from producing pro-inflammatory factors, which are triggered by the structural elements of bacteria (like lipopolysaccharide).

Owing to their location in a portion of the gastrointestinal tract which is not easily accessible to conventional endoscopic techniques, the detection of CD-related small bowel cancers is still a clinical challenge. The radiological features of CD-related small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) in patients with CD have been described in some previous studies, including its appearance in both CT and MRI examinations. Radiological signs of active or fibrostenotic CD may be intermixed with those suggesting the presence of CD-related SBA. In CT studies, the most relevant findings consistent with malignant transformation are the presence of a stricture with irregular asymmetric thickening of small bowel walls, loss of mural stratification, and moderate enhancement after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast media, in association with enlarged adjacent mesenteric lymph nodes. Many of the CD-related SBA features that can be observed on CT imaging are similar to those detectable by MRI. This latter modality provides the additional value of the functional characterization of small bowel strictures, thereby helping to distinguish between inflammatory, fibrotic, and malignant stenosis in the setting of active CD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT enables the metabolic assessment of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and PET/MRI fusion imaging can incorporate morphological, functional and metabolic information into a single set of imaging data, thus overcoming the limitations of the separate assessment of each individual modality. Owing to the low incidence and prevalence of this long-term complication of CD, we believe that a detailed multimodality pictorial essay on this topic, also including the PET-CT and fusion imaging documentation of some cases, would be useful to the medical literature.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38441632/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "38432648", "Title": "The Management of Colorectal Neoplasia in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.", "Abstract": "The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), comprising Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.
