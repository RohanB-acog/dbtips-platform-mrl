The better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the different manifestations of NS and RASopathies has led to the identification of molecular targets for specific pharmacological interventions.

As for any condition with lifelong effects on multiple organ systems, a multidisciplinary approach provides the best care. It is proposed that increasing awareness of NS among non-specialist HCPs and other professionals could help direct a parent/carer to seek specialist advice and increase the number of NS diagnoses, with the potential to optimise lifelong patient outcomes.

We focus on cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, where Ras has been studied the most. We also review other cardiac diseases, like genetic disorders related to Ras. The scope of the review extends from fundamental concepts to therapeutic applications. Although the three Ras genes have a nearly identical primary structure, there are important functional differences between them: H-Ras mainly regulates cardiomyocyte size, whereas K-Ras regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation. N-Ras is the least studied in cardiac cells and is less associated to cardiac defects. Clinically, oncogenic H-Ras causes Costello syndrome and facio-cutaneous-skeletal syndromes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. On the other hand, oncogenic K-Ras and alterations of other genes of the Ras-Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, like Raf, cause Noonan syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes characterized by cardiac hypertrophy and septal defects. We further review the modulation by Ras of key signaling pathways in the cardiomyocyte, including: (i) the classical Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, which leads to a more physiological form of cardiac hypertrophy; as well as other pathways associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy, like (ii) The SAPK (stress activated protein kinase) pathways p38 and JNK; and (iii) The alternative pathway Raf-Calcineurin-Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT).

Longitudinal growth during childhood and adolescence depends on several factors, among them an intact somatotrophic axis, which is characterized by an adequate growth hormone (GH) secretion by the pituitary, subsequent binding to its receptor, proper function of the post-receptor signaling pathway for this hormone (JAK-STAT5b and RAS/MAPK), and ultimately by the production of its main effector, insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Several studies regarding the function of the somatotrophic axis in patients with Noonan syndrome and data from murine models, suggest that partial GH insensitivity at a post-receptor level, as well as possible derangements in the RAS/MAPK pathway, are the most likely causes for the growth failure in these patients. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been used extensively to promote linear growth in these patients. Numerous treatment protocols have been employed so far, but the published studies are quite heterogeneous regarding patient selection, length of treatment, and dose of rhGH utilized, so the true benefit of GH therapy is somewhat difficult to establish.

We present a critical appraisal of the concept of GHND and the role of 12- or 24-h GH profiles in the selection of children for GH treatment. The mean 24-h GH concentration in healthy children overlaps with that in those with GH deficiency, indicating that the previously proposed cutoff limit (3.0-3.2 \u03bcg/L) is too high. The main advantage of performing a GH profile is that it prevents about 20% of false-positive test results of the GHST, while it also detects a low spontaneous GH secretion in children who would be considered GH sufficient based on a stimulation test. However, due to a considerable burden for patients and the health budget, GH profiles are only used in few centres. Regarding genetic causes, there is good evidence of the existence of Kowarski syndrome (due to GH1 variants) but less on the role of GHSR variants. Several genetic causes of (partial) GHI are known (GHR, STAT5B, STAT3, IGF1, IGFALS defects, and Noonan and 3M syndromes), some responding positively to GH therapy.

M-Ras is related to classical Ras with regard to its regulators and effectors, but solely constitutes a subfamily among the Ras family members. Although classical Ras strongly binds Raf and highly activates the ERK pathway, M-Ras less strongly binds Raf and moderately but sustainedly activates the ERK pathway to induce neuronal differentiation. M-Ras also possesses specific effectors, including RapGEFs and the PP1 complex Shoc2-PP1c, which dephosphorylates Raf to activate the ERK pathway. M-Ras is highly expressed in the brain and plays essential roles in dendrite formation during neurogenesis, in contrast to the axon formation by R-Ras. M-Ras is also highly expressed in the bone and induces osteoblastic differentiation and transdifferentiation accompanied by calcification. Moreover, M-Ras elicits epithelial-mesenchymal transition-mediated collective and single cell migration through the PP1 complex-mediated ERK pathway activation. Activating missense mutations in the MRAS gene have been detected in Noonan syndrome, one of the RASopathies, and MRAS gene amplification occurs in several cancers. Furthermore, several SNPs in the MRAS gene are associated with coronary artery disease, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Therefore, M-Ras carries out a variety of cellular, physiological, and pathological functions.

Emerging clinical evidences have now demonstrated a role for RIT1 in RASopathies, namely Noonan syndrome, and various cancers including lung adenocarcinoma and myeloid malignancies.

It remains unclear why (i) there is little overlap in mutational subtype between Ras-driven malignancies associated with sporadic disease and those associated with the RASopathy syndromes, and (ii) RASopathy-associated cancers are usually of different histological origin to those seen with sporadic mutations of the same genes. For instance, germline variants in KRAS and NRAS are rarely found at codons 12, 13 or 61, the most common sites for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers. An exception is CS, where germline variants in codons 12 and 13 of HRAS occur relatively frequently.

More than 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome harbor PTPN11 pathogenic variation, which results in hyperactivation of RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Several other disease genes with similar biological effects have been uncovered for NS and phenotypically related disorders, collectively called the RASopathies. Molecular diagnosis with gene resequencing panels is now widely available, but phenotype variability and in some cases, subtlety, continues to make identification of Noonan syndrome difficult. Until genetic testing becomes universal for patients with congenital heart disease, alertness to Noonan syndrome's broad clinical presentations remains crucial.
