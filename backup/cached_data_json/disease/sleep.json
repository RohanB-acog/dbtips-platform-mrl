Drawing insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD.

While the sleep-wake behaviors are primarily modulated by homeostasis and circadian rhythm, several ambient chemical and physical factors, including light, sound, odor, vibration, temperature, electromagnetic radiation, and ultrasound, also affect sleep and wakefulness. Light at different wavelengths has different effects on sleep and wakefulness. Sound not only promotes but also suppresses sleep; this effect is mediated by certain nuclei, including the pedunculopontine nucleus and inferior colliculus. Certain sleep-promoting odorants regulate sleep through the involvement of the olfactory bulb and olfactory tubercle. In addition, vibrations may induce sleep through the vestibular system. A modest increase in ambient temperature leads to an increase in sleep duration through the involvement of the preoptic area. Electromagnetic radiation has a dual effect on sleep-wake behaviors. The stimulation produced by the ambient chemical and physical factors activates the peripheral sensory system, which converts the chemical and physical stimuli into nerve impulses. This signal is then transmitted to the central nervous system, including several nuclei associated with the modulation of sleep-wake behaviors.

There is a strong association between trauma-related nightmares and insomnia with higher rates of physical illness, mental distress, and suicide among PTSD patients. Prazosin, an \u03b11-adrenergic antagonist, has shown mixed results in treating these sleep disturbances. This study aims to evaluate the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on insomnia, nightmares, and global PTSD symptoms, and to examine variables that might influence this effect. We conducted a meta-analysis and a novel meta-regression analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing prazosin to placebo in samples of patients with PTSD. Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and PTSD Pubs. Examined variables were age, gender, military/civilian status, prazosin dose, treatment duration, baseline symptom severity, use of antidepressants, use of benzodiazepines (BDZ), prevalence of depression, and alcohol use disorder. Ten RCTs with 648 patients were included.

At subanesthetic doses, ketamine induces transient psychosis in humans, and is used to model psychosis in experimental animals.

However, to date, the effects of ketamine in carnivores and primates have been poorly investigated. Here, we examined in the cat, cortical HFO during wakefulness, sleep, and after administering a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine. Four cats were prepared with cortical electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recordings in head-restrained conditions. The cortical HFO power, connectivity, direction of the information flow using Granger Causality (GC) analysis, their relationships with respiratory activity, and the effect of auditory stimulation were analyzed. During wakefulness, but not during sleep, we found that HFO were coupled with the inspiratory phase of the respiration. After ketamine administration, HFO power was enhanced and remained associated with the inspiratory phase. GC analysis suggests that ketamine-enhanced HFO originate from the olfactory bulb (OB) and stream towards the prefrontal cortex (Pf). Accordingly, occluding the nostrils significantly reduced the power of the ketamine-enhanced HFO in both the OB and Pf. Finally, auditory stimulation did not affect HFO. In conclusion, the HFO are associated with respiration during wakefulness, but not during sleep.

These immunological functions depend on regular sleep and circadian rhythms, as both impact the magnitude of immune responses. Circadian rhythm is the 24-h internal clock in our brain that regulates cycles of alertness and sleepiness by responding to light changes in our environment. It encompasses physical and behavioral daily oscillations. Sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment affect immunity, and both have been related to adverse health effects and chronic diseases. Studies have shown that individuals with regular and consistent sleep patterns have a more effective immune response. Thus, understanding how sleep disturbance will affect the immune response is vital in developing interventions to prevent the health burden of irregular sleep patterns and circadian misalignment, favoring a homeostatic immune defense to microbial or inflammatory insults.

This is because efferent projections from the SCN reach other hypothalamic nuclei, the pineal gland, thalamus, basal forebrain, and the brainstem. The ipRGCs also directly impact the prefrontal cortex and the perihabenular nucleus (mood).

These cognitive domains are deeply influenced by the sleep-wake cycle, which are governed by two key processes: the homeostatic process, which builds sleep pressure during wakefulness, and the circadian process, which aligns with environmental light cues to regulate wakefulness and sleep. When these processes fall out of sync-a condition known as circadian misalignment-alertness, sustained attention, and cognitive performance can suffer significantly. This misalignment is often observed in shift workers, individuals experiencing jet lag, and those with circadian rhythm sleep disorders. However, strategic light exposure can help mitigate these cognitive impairments by realigning circadian rhythms, enhancing wakefulness during desired periods, and facilitating sleep when needed.

Sleep-wake disturbances are among the most persistent and debilitating consequences of TBI and are reported by 50%-70% of TBI patients regardless of TBI severity. Excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, hypersomnia, and insomnia are the most common sleep disturbances in TBI patients. Post-TBI sleep-wake disturbances are often associated with pain, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. They may exacerbate cognitive impairment following TBI, reduce community integration, and delay recovery and return to normal life. Changes in sleep architecture following TBI have been reported in the literature but cannot fully explain the extent and intensity of the sleep-wake disturbances reported by TBI patients. The alteration in the circadian timing system is another factor that may partially account for the presence of post-TBI sleep-wake disturbances. Current literature supports cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep hygiene education, light therapy, and certain pharmacologic interventions for treating sleep disturbances in TBI patients.

Drawing from animal and human studies, we discuss neurobiological mechanisms by which biotics may influence sleep, including modulation of neurotransmitters, immune responses, and hormonal regulation. Key microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, are highlighted for their role in supporting sleep-related neurochemical processes.

This is one of the first studies to specify that, when paired with affiliation, both moderate control and moderate autonomy-granting were associated with better adolescent sleep health.

Observational studies showed an association between excessive video gaming, poor sleep quality, and delayed sleep timing, whereas habitual and/or casual use was not associated with poor sleep and some studies even showed a beneficial effect on daytime functioning. Experimental evidence shows that playing an arousing VG before sleep delays sleep onset with possible alteration of sleep structure, whereas non-arousing cognitively challenging video gaming resulted in improved sleep continuity, stability, and organization.

Infants born preterm are at four times the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) compared to infants born at term. SIDS is believed to be multifactorial in origin. The Triple Risk hypothesis has been proposed to explain this. The model suggests that when a vulnerable infant, such as one born preterm, is at a critical but unstable developmental period in homeostatic control, death may occur if exposed to an exogenous stressor, such as being placed prone for sleep. The highest risk period is at ages 2-4 months, with 90\u00a0% of deaths occurring before 6 months.

The fibre types included cotton, polyester, wool, and blended materials for sleepwear; cotton, duck down, goose down, polyester and wool for duvet; and linen and a combination of cotton and polyester for bedding. The interplay between fibre materials and sleep quality is complex. Blended sleepwear demonstrated potential benefits for specific populations. Wool sleepwear showed benefits for sleep onset in adults (cool conditions) and in older adults (warm conditions). Linen bedsheets improved sleep quality under warm conditions in young adults. Goose down-filled duvets increased slow-wave sleep under cool conditions in young adults.

Sleep extension, or increasing total sleep duration, is an emerging and ecologically relevant intervention with significant potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the association between short sleep duration and the risk of cardiometabolic disease. If effective, sleep extension interventions have potential to improve cardiometabolic health across the lifespan. Existing data show that sleep extension is feasible and might have potential cardiometabolic health benefits, although there are limitations that the field must overcome. Notably, most existing studies are short term (2-8\u00a0weeks), use different sleep extension strategies, analyse a wide array of cardiometabolic health outcomes in different populations and, frequently, lack adequate statistical power, thus limiting robust scientific conclusions. Overcoming these limitations will require fully powered, randomized studies conducted in people with habitual short sleep duration and existing cardiometabolic risk factors. Additionally, randomized controlled trials comparing different sleep extension strategies are essential to determine the most effective interventions.

Sleep disturbances are not only symptoms but also mediators in the relationship between depression and other conditions, such as anxiety, chronic inflammation, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive decline. Effective management of depressive disorders must address these sleep issues. Bright light therapy, which uses artificial light to mimic natural sunlight, is effective for treating seasonal affective disorder and non-seasonal major depressive disorder. It is well tolerated, can be used alone or with antidepressants, and often improves both mood and sleep quality. In contrast, sleep deprivation, which involves enforced wakefulness, can provide rapid symptom relief. However, its effects are generally short-lived, and there is a risk of inducing mania in patients with bipolar disorder. In conclusion, sleep significantly impacts the severity and progression of depressive disorders. Bright light therapy and sleep deprivation offer promising alternatives to conventional treatments.

Recent research has linked sleep to various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegeneration, which are associated with various molecular changes in different cellular environments. Despite the potential significance of various molecules, the HSPA1A or Hsp70 protein, which has possible connections with sleep and different neuropsychological and pathological disorders, has been explored the least. This paper explores the potential for manipulating and discovering drugs related to the Hsp70 protein to alleviate sleep problems and improve the prognosis for various other health issues. This paper discusses the critical role of Hsp70 in cancer, neurodegeneration, apoptosis, sleep, and its regulation at the structural level through allosteric mechanisms and different substrates. The significant impact of Hsp70's connection to various conditions suggests that existing sleep medicine could be used to improve such conditions, leading to improved outcomes, minimized research costs, and a new direction for current research. Overall, this paper highlights the potential of Hsp70 protein as a key therapeutic target for developing new drugs for the treatment of sleep disorders, cancer, neurodegeneration, and other related pathological conditions. Further research into the molecular mechanisms of Hsp70 regulation and its interactions with other cellular pathways is necessary to develop targeted treatments for these conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

They function as synaptic fine-tuners and master coordinators of neuronal activity across distant brain regions and body organs. While much research on neuromodulation has focused on roles in promoting features of wakefulness and transitions between sleep and wake states, the precise dynamics and functions of neuromodulatory signaling during sleep have received less attention. This review discusses research presented at our minisymposium at the 2024 Society for Neuroscience meeting, highlighting how norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine orchestrate brain oscillatory activity, control sleep architecture and microarchitecture, regulate responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and facilitate memory consolidation. The potential of each neuromodulator to influence neuronal activity is shaped by the state of the synaptic milieu, which in turn is influenced by the organismal or systemic state. Investigating the effects of neuromodulator release across different sleep substates and synaptic environments offers unique opportunities to deepen our understanding of neuromodulation and explore the distinct computational opportunities that arise during sleep.

Normal sleep consists of an orderly progression through wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, all of which are tightly regulated. Melatonin, often referred to as the \"hormone of sleep,\" plays a pivotal role as a regulator of the sleep/wake cycle and exerts its effects through high-affinity G-protein coupled receptors known as MT1 and MT2. Selective modulation of these receptors presents a promising therapeutic avenue for sleep disorders. This review examines research on the multifaceted role of melatonin in sleep regulation, focusing on selective ligands targeting MT1 and MT2 receptors, as well as studies involving MT1 and MT2 knockout mice. Contrary to common beliefs, growing evidence suggests that melatonin, through MT1 and MT2 receptors, might not only influence circadian aspects of sleep but likely, also modulate the homeostatic process of sleep and sleep architecture, or could be the molecule linking the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep. Furthermore, the distinct brain localization of MT1 and MT2 receptors, with MT1 receptors primarily regulating REM sleep and MT2 receptors regulating NREM sleep, is discussed. Collectively, sleep regulation extends beyond the circulating levels and circadian peak of melatonin; it also critically involves the expression, molecular activation, and regulatory functions of MT1 and MT2 receptors across various brain regions and nuclei involved in the regulation of sleep. This research underscores the importance of ongoing investigation into the selective roles of MT1 and MT2 receptors in sleep. Such research efforts are expected to pave the way for the development of targeted MT1 or MT2 receptors ligands, thereby optimizing therapeutic interventions for sleep disorders.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39400423/", "Qualifers": ["physiology"]}, {"PMID": "39354392", "Title": "Sleep quality disparities in different pregnancy trimesters in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Sleep is a crucial determinant of maternal and fetal health, significantly impacting the well-being of both the mother and her developing fetus.

Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population.

Reaction to and processing of external stimuli is attenuated in sleep. During sleep, the reticular thalamic nucleus reduces the flow of sensory activity to the cerebral cortex through inhibition of the thalamus. This sensory gating process facilitates sleep. After reaching the afferent layers of primary cortex, the reduced sensory flow is adjusted, gained, and processed within various cortical layers before being transferred by the corticofugal system back to appropriate subdivisions of the thalamus as feedback. Thalamic subdivisions then dispatch this sensory information to related areas of the cerebral cortex, where it is (sub)consciously perceived. When necessary, a sleeping individual can be awakened by a wake-up call, either by stimuli indicating danger, or by personally meaningful stimuli. It is safe for a sleeping individual that it can be aroused when necessary. Evidently, there are two processes by which the brain adjusts the response to sensory stimuli before entering (sub)consciousness. Firstly 'sensory gating', a process favourable to the maintenance of sleep by reducing the sensory input to the brain through the reticular thalamic nucleus and secondly 'sensory gaining', a process implying that the gained preserved sensory input is continuously analysed by the corticofugal system to detect dangerous and relevant environmental elements, indispensable for safeness and well-being of the sleeper.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38286435/", "Qualifers": ["physiology"]}, {"PMID": "38253963", "Title": "Effect of daily light exposure on sleep in polar regions: A meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Although studies have shown that light affects sleep in polar populations, the sample size of most studies is small.

Additionally, it may influence circadian melatonin balance, that may indirectly induce sleep regulation, which in turn could potentially contribute to vitiligo improvement. The association between melatonin, vitiligo and phototherapy has been little investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current evidence regarding the effects of circadian melatonin regulation and sleep, particularly during vitiligo treatment with phototherapy. We undertook a narrative review to synthetize the evidence on this association through the MEDLINE/PubMed database, using combined search terms: melatonin, vitiligo, phototherapy, and circadian rhythm (sleep). A total of 56 articles were included. There are few studies on this relationship, and conflicting findings. Some studies have suggested that UV exposure and phototherapy might benefit vitiligo by stimulating melanocytes, which have melatonin receptors, and this could potentially synchronize the circadian regulation of melatonin. This improved melatonin balance could result in better sleep quality further enhancing the antiinflammatory properties of melatonin and contributing to vitiligo improvement. Less is known about the possible effects of the use of topical melatonin, with or without phototherapy, to treat vitiligo lesions. In conclusion, there is some evidence that circadian melatonin regulation plays an important role in the course of vitiligo, both through sleep regulation and its anti-inflammatory properties. The evidence suggests that the systemic and physiological properties of melatonin, especially its circadian behavior regulated by phototherapy, may be more effective in respect of vitiligo improvement than the use of topical melatonin. However, the effects of the oral intake of melatonin are less clear.

Physiologically, inadequate sleep weakens immune function, heightening susceptibility to infections and chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Hormonal disruptions due to sleep loss further exacerbate metabolic dysregulation, contributing to weight gain and other health complications. Emotionally, sleep deprivation leads to mood disturbances, including increased irritability, heightened stress responses, and a greater likelihood of mood disorders like depression and anxiety. These effects are compounded by cognitive impairments such as reduced alertness, impaired memory consolidation, and compromised decision-making abilities, akin to the impairments caused by alcohol consumption. Motor skills and coordination also suffer, elevating the risk of accidents, particularly in high-stress environments. For older adults, sleep quality is closely linked to cognitive function and overall longevity. Optimal sleep patterns are associated with slower brain aging and improved health outcomes. However, sleep disorders exacerbate existing conditions such as epilepsy and asthma, necessitating interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medications such as melatonin to mitigate their impact. Education emerges as a crucial tool in promoting healthier sleep habits across all age groups. Addressing misconceptions about sleep and integrating sleep health into public health policies are essential steps toward improving overall well-being. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity play significant roles in regulating sleep patterns, further emphasizing the interconnectedness of sleep with broader health outcomes.

There were limited studies and timeframe alignment to analyse prebiotics, synbiotics, post-biotics, and para-probiotics effects on infant sleep duration. The study suggests probiotic supplementation does not increase infant sleep duration within the first 4 postpartum weeks and may contribute to reduced sleep duration in the fifth week. Limited studies were available to assess the effects of biotic supplementation over the first 12 postpartum months.

Studies have indicated that diets such as PBDs, which are typically high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and fiber, are associated with better sleep outcomes, including less fragmented sleep and improved sleep duration. Several mechanisms may explain how PBDs impact and/or improve sleep outcomes. Firstly, PBDs are characteristically rich in certain nutrients, such as magnesium and vitamin B6, which have been associated with improved sleep patterns. Secondly, PBDs are often lower in saturated fats and higher in fiber, which may contribute to better overall health, including sleep quality. Additionally, plant bioactive compounds like phytochemicals and antioxidants in fruits, vegetables, and herbs may have sleep-promoting effects.

Memories are believed to be stored within specific populations of neurons known as engram cells, which are subsequently reactivated during sleep, facilitating the consolidation of stored information. However, sleep and offline reactivations are associated not only with past experiences but also with anticipation of future events. During periods of offline reactivation, which occur during sleep and quiet wakefulness, the brain exhibits a capability to form novel connections. This process links various past experiences, often leading to the emergence of qualitatively new information that was not initially available. Brain activity during sleep and quiet wakefulness is referred to as the 'idling brain'. Idling brain activity is believed to play a pivotal role in abstracting essential information, comprehending underlying rules, generating creative ideas and fostering insightful thoughts.

This review synthesizes the current knowledge on how sleep influences immune function, the immune system's role in cancer dynamics, and the direct connections between sleep patterns and cancer risk. After a comprehensive overview of the interrelationships among these three domains, the mechanisms of sleep in immune function are described, detailing how sleep regulates the immune system, the effects of sleep duration and quality on immune responses, and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Also, the complex relationship between immunity and cancer is explored, highlighting the immune system's role in cancer prevention and progression, immune surveillance, tumor microenvironment, and the implications of immunodeficiency and immune modulation on cancer risk. The direct connections between sleep and cancer are then described, presenting epidemiological evidence linking sleep patterns to cancer risk, biological mechanisms that influence cancer development, and the role of sleep disorders in cancer prognosis. The mediating role of sleep between immunity and cancer is highlighted, proposing hypothesized pathways, summarizing evidence from experimental and clinical studies, and evaluating the impact of sleep interventions on immune function and cancer outcomes. This review concludes by discussing the clinical implications and future directions, emphasizing the potential for sleep-based interventions in cancer prevention and treatment, the integration of sleep management in oncology and immunotherapy, and outlining a future research agenda.

Over the lifespan, a bell curve pattern emerges in circadian phase preference (i.e. chronotype), with children and adults generally preferring to wake earlier and fall asleep earlier, and adolescents and young adults preferring to wake later and fall asleep later than their adult counterparts. This well-defined shift speaks to the variability of circadian rhythmicity over the lifespan and the changing needs and demands of the brain as an organism develops, particularly in the adolescent period. Indeed, adolescence is known to be a critical period of development during which dramatic neuroanatomical changes are occurring to allow for improved decision-making. Due to the large amount of re-structuring occurring in the adolescent brain, circadian disruptions during this period could have adverse consequences that persist across the lifespan. While the detrimental effects of circadian disruptions in adults have been characterized in depth, few studies have longitudinally assessed the potential long-term impacts of circadian disruptions during adolescence. Here, we will review the evidence that disruptions in circadian rhythmicity during adolescence have effects that persist into adulthood.

The intrinsic circadian system (CS) represents a highly conserved and complex internal biological \"clock\", adjusted to the 24-hour rotation of the earth about itself. This system creates and maintains cellular and organismal rhythmicity and enables a nyctohemeral coordination of multi-level physiologic processes, ranging from gene expression to behaviour. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the primary pacemaker of the circadian system of the organism, while a ubiquitous peripheral oscillating network of cellular molecular clocks participates in a complex circadian hierarchy. A critical loss of this harmoniously timed circadian order at different organizational levels is defined as \"chronodisruption\", a condition that may alter the fundamental properties of basic homeostatic systems at molecular, cellular and organismal levels, and lead to a breakdown of biobehavioral adaptive mechanisms, resulting in maladaptive stress regulation and increased sensitivity and vulnerability to stress. Chronodisruption has been linked to neuroendocrine, immune, cardiometabolic and autonomic dysregulation, with blunted diurnal rhythms, specific sleep pattern pathologies and cognitive deficits, as well as with altered circadian gene expression.

Such investigations are often challenging due to patient size (prematurity), tolerability, and compliance with \"gold standard\" equipment. Children with sensory/behavioural issues, at increased risk of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), often find standard diagnostic equipment difficult.SDB can have implications for a child both in terms of physical health and neurocognitive development. Potential sequelae of untreated SDB includes failure to thrive, cardiopulmonary disease, impaired learning and behavioural issues. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of SDB is important to facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes.The current gold-standard diagnostic test for SDB is polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive, requiring the interpretation of a highly specialised physiologist. PSG is not feasible in low-income countries or outwith specialist sleep centres. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, efforts were made to improve remote monitoring and diagnostics in paediatric sleep medicine, resulting in a paradigm shift in SDB technology with a focus on automated diagnosis harnessing artificial intelligence (AI). AI enables interrogation of large datasets, setting the scene for an era of \"sleep-omics\", characterising the endotypic and phenotypic bedrock of SDB by drawing on genetic, lifestyle and demographic information. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently announced a programme for the development of automated home-testing devices for SDB.

However, our understanding of the neural and molecular basis of sleep regulation has increased rapidly in recent years. Among various processes implicated in controlling sleep homeostasis, a bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress has recently emerged. One proposed function of sleep may be the mitigation of oxidative stress in both brain and peripheral tissues, contributing to the clearance of reactive species that accumulate during wakefulness. Conversely, reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), at physiological levels, may act as signaling agents to regulate redox-sensitive transcriptional factors, enzymes, and other effectors involved in the regulation of sleep. As a primary sensor of intracellular oxidation, the transcription factor NRF2 is emerging as an indispensable component to maintain cellular redox homeostasis during sleep. Indeed, a number of studies have revealed an association between NRF2 dysfunction and the most common sleep conditions, including sleep loss, obstructive sleep apnea, and circadian sleep disturbances. This review examines the evidence of the intricate link between oxidative stress and NRF2 function in the context of sleep, and highlights the potential of NRF2 modulators to alleviate sleep disturbances.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38916679/", "Qualifers": ["physiology"]}, {"PMID": "38837997", "Title": "The effects of nonpharmacological sleep hygiene on sleep quality in nonelderly individuals: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of locomotive syndrome naturally increases with age, but approximately half of nonelderly individuals also meet the criteria for locomotive syndrome, suggesting that even younger people need to pay attention to their own health status.

We also learn that the ongoing state of the substrate of consciousness determines the way each experience feels regardless of how it is triggered-endogenously or exogenously. Dreaming consciousness is also a window on sleep and its functions. Dreams tell us that the sleeping brain is remarkably lively, recombining intrinsic activation patterns from a vast repertoire, freed from the requirements of ongoing behavior and cognitive control.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38697113/", "Qualifers": ["physiology"]}, {"PMID": "38807992", "Title": "Prevalence and determinants of poor sleep quality among diabetic patients in Ethiopia: systematic review.", "Abstract": "Poor sleep quality can exacerbate many other physiological functions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure.

A generalist may not be aware of the current status of the field given the variety of journals that have published studies on the genetics of sleep and the circadian clock over the years. For researchers venturing into this fascinating area, this review thus includes fundamental features of circadian rhythm and genetic variables impacting sleep-wake cycles. Sleep/wake pathway medication exposure and susceptibility are influenced by genetic variations, and the responsiveness of sleep-related medicines is influenced by several functional polymorphisms. This review highlights the features of the circadian timing system and then a genetic perspective on wakefulness and sleep, as well as the relationship between sleep genetics and sleep disorders. Neurotransmission genes, as well as circadian and sleep/wake receptors, exhibit functional variability. Experiments on animals and humans have shown that these genetic variants impact clock systems, signaling pathways, nature, amount, duration, type, intensity, quality, and quantity of sleep. In this regard, the overview covers research on sleep genetics, the genomic properties of several popular model species used in sleep studies, homologs of mammalian genes, sleep disorders, and related genes. In addition, the study includes a brief discussion of sleep, narcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome from the viewpoint of a model organism.

However, the effect of later school start time on different outcomes varies between studies, and most previous literature only takes into consideration the social clock (i.e. local time of school starting time) but not the solar clock (e.g. the distance between school start time and sunrise). Thus, there is an important gap in the literature: when assessing the effect of a school start time on chronotype and sleep of adolescents at different locations and/or seasons, the solar clock might differ and, consistently, the obtained results. For example, the earliest school start time for adolescents has been suggested to be 08:30\u2009hours, but this school start time might correspond to different solar times at different times of the year, longitudes and latitudes. Here, we describe the available literature comparing different school start times, considering important factors such as geographic position, nationality, and the local school start time and its distance to sunrise.

These changes do not occur all at once. The sleep onset period (SOP) refers here to this period of transition between wakefulness and sleep. For example, although transitions of brain activity at sleep onset can occur within seconds in a given brain region, these changes occur at different time points across the brain, resulting in a SOP that can last several minutes. Likewise, the transition to sleep impacts cognitive and behavioral levels in a graded and staged fashion. It is often accompanied and preceded by a sensation of drowsiness and the subjective feeling of a need for sleep, also associated with specific physiological and behavioral signatures. To better characterize fluctuations in vigilance and the SOP, a multidimensional approach is thus warranted. Such a multidimensional approach could mitigate important limitations in the current classification of sleep, leading ultimately to better diagnoses and treatments of individuals with sleep and/or vigilance disorders.

We propose that muscle atonia during PS is due to activation of glutamatergic neurons localized in the pontine sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) projecting to glycinergic/GABAergic pre-motoneurons localized in the ventro-medial medulla (vmM). The SLD PS-on neurons are inactivated during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep by PS-off GABAergic neurons localized in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) and the adjacent deep mesencephalic reticular nucleus. Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and GABAergic PS-on neurons localized in the posterior hypothalamus would inhibit these PS-off neurons to initiate the state. Finally, the activation of a few limbic cortical structures during PS by the claustrum and the supramammillary nucleus as well as that of the basolateral amygdala would also contribute to PS expression. Accumulating evidence indicates that the activation of these limbic structures plays a role in memory consolidation and would communicate to the PS-generating structures the need for PS to process memory.

It combines, among other things, an excessive propensity to fall asleep (\"physiological sleepiness\") and a continuous non-imperative sleepiness (or drowsiness/hypo-arousal) leading to difficulties remaining awake and maintaining sustained attention and vigilance over the long term (\"manifest sleepiness\"). There is no stand-alone biological measure of EDS. EDS measures can either capture the severity of physiological sleepiness, which corresponds to the propensity to fall asleep, or the severity of manifest sleepiness, which corresponds to behavioral consequences of sleepiness and reduced vigilance. Neuropsychological tests (The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), Oxford Sleep Resistance Test (OSLeR), Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)) explore manifest sleepiness through several sustained attention tests but the lack of normative values and standardized protocols make the results difficult to interpret and use in clinical practice. Neurophysiological tests explore the two main aspects of EDS, i.e. the propensity to fall asleep (Multiple sleep latency test, MSLT) and the capacity to remain awake (Maintenance of wakefulness test, MWT). The MSLT and the MWT are widely used in clinical practice. The MSLT is recognized as the \"gold standard\" test for measuring the severity of the propensity to fall asleep and it is a diagnostic criterion for narcolepsy. The MWT measures the ability to stay awake. The MWT is not a diagnostic test as it is recommended only to evaluate the evolution of EDS and efficacy of EDS treatment. Even if some efforts to standardize the protocols for administration of these tests have been ongoing, MSLT and MWT have numerous limitations: age effect, floor or ceiling effects, binding protocol, no normal or cutoff value (or determined in small samples), and no or low test-retest values in some pathologies. Moreover, the recommended electrophysiological set-up and the determination of sleep onset using the 30\u2011sec epochs scoring rule show some limitations.

Scalp and intracranial electro-encephalography as well as functional imaging studies have provided evidence that the sleep inertia phenomenon is underpinned by an heterogenous cerebral state mixing local sleep and local wake patterns of activity, at the neuronal and network levels. Sleep inertia is modulated by homeostasis and circadian processes, sleep stage upon awakening, and individual factors; this translates into a huge variability in its intensity even under physiological conditions. In sleep disorders, especially in hypersomnolence disorders such as idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep inertia may be a daily, serious and long-lasting symptom leading to severe impairment. To date, few tools have been developed to assess sleep inertia in clinical practice. They include mainly questionnaires and behavioral tests such as the psychomotor vigilance task.

Finally, we briefly address some strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of sleep deprivation.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38387838/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "38301414", "Title": "Peer effects in weight-related behaviours of young people: A systematic literature review.", "Abstract": "Individual preferences and beliefs are perpetually shaped by environmental influences, with peers playing a key role in this dynamic process. Compelling evidence from qualitative and quantitative studies has highlighted the significant impact of peer influence on health-related decisions. This systematic literature review critically synthesises findings from 45 studies published between 2011 and 2022, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of peer effects on dietary, physical activity and sleep behaviours during youth. The majority of studies indicated that social norms drive directional changes in eating and physical activity. Yet, our analysis revealed a notable gap in exploring alternative mechanisms, including social comparison and social identity, despite their potential relevance. Studies, generally classified as moderate to high quality, predominantly relied on self-reported data, potentially affecting the validity and reliability of measures. Meta-regression analyses suggest a small, but significant association of sample size with the magnitude, sign and significance of the reported peer effects. Moreover, studies focusing on physical activity are more likely to report significant outcomes, whereas findings on peer influence on sleep-related studies tend to reveal less pronounced effects, compared to studies on dietary behaviours. Experimental designs do not appear to increase the likelihood of finding significant effects when compared to other study designs.

However, brains are known to generate virtual experiences, such as during imagination and dreaming, that go beyond previously experienced inputs. Here, we suggest that virtual experiences may be just as relevant as actual sensory inputs in shaping cortical representations. In particular, we discuss two complementary learning principles that organize representations through the generation of virtual experiences. First, \"adversarial dreaming\" proposes that creative dreams support a cortical implementation of adversarial learning in which feedback and feedforward pathways engage in a productive game of trying to fool each other. Second, \"contrastive dreaming\" proposes that the invariance of neuronal representations to irrelevant factors of variation is acquired by trying to map similar virtual experiences together via a contrastive learning process.

Sleep regulates the production and secretion of hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, both at the central nervous system (CNS) and at the periphery. Sleep promotes the removal of potentially toxic metabolites out of the brain through specialized systems such as the glymphatic system, as well as the expression of specific transporters in the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier maintains CNS homeostasis by selectively transporting metabolic substrates and nutrients into the brain, by regulating the efflux of metabolic waste products, and maintaining bidirectional communication between the periphery and the CNS. All those processes are disrupted during sleep loss. Brain endothelial cells express the blood-brain barrier phenotype, which arises after cell-to-cell interactions with mural cells, like pericytes, and after the release of soluble factors by astroglial endfeet. Astroglia, pericytes and brain endothelial cells respond differently to sleep loss; evidence has shown that sleep loss induces a chronic low-grade inflammatory state at the CNS, which is associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction. In animal models, blood-brain barrier dysfunction is characterized by increased blood-brain barrier permeability, decreased tight junction protein expression and pericyte detachment from the capillary wall. Blood-brain barrier dysfunction may promote defects in brain clearance of potentially neurotoxic metabolites and byproducts of neural physiology, which may eventually contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.

Alterations in genes\u00a0that are central to circadian rhythmicity affect not only sleep timing but also putative markers of sleep homeostasis such as electroencephalogram slow-wave activity (SWA).

Changes in the expression of many genes in response to sleep perturbations outlast the effects on SWA and time spent asleep.

Sleep enhances memory consolidation, especially for complex declarative information. While the role of sleep in procedural memory consolidation in children remains less robust compared to declarative memory, findings suggest potential but inconsistent benefits. Sleep improves prospective memory consolidation and aids in complex associative memory tasks. Memory reactivation during sleep, specifically slow-wave sleep, and spindles are implicated in memory consolidation. Meta-analytic evidence suggests that while sleep benefits both emotional and neutral memory consolidation, there is no strong preferential effect of sleep on emotional memory in comparison to neutral memory. In older adults, there is a noticeable reduction in sleep-dependent memory consolidation, particularly for declarative memory, likely linked to a decline in slow-wave sleep. This suggests a decrease in the benefits of sleep for memory consolidation with aging.

Sleep is viewed as essential to the recuperation process and is distinguished as an active participant in recovery through its involvement in growth, repair, regeneration, and immunity. Furthermore, the literature has shown that the sleep of athletes impacts elements of athletic performance including both physical and cognitive performance, recovery, injury risk, and mental well-being. For sleep to have a restorative effect on the body, it must meet an individual's sleep needs whilst also lasting for an adequate duration and being of adequate quality, which is age-dependent. The literature has suggested that athletes have increased sleep needs compared to those of the general population and thus the standard recommendations may not be sufficient for athletic populations. Therefore, a more individualised approach accounting for overall sleep health may be more appropriate for addressing sleep needs in individuals including athletes. The literature has demonstrated that adolescent athletes achieve, on average, ~6.3 h of sleep, demonstrating a discrepancy between sleep recommendations (8-10 h) and actual sleep achieved. Sleep-wake cycles undergo development during adolescence whereby adaptation occurs in sleep regulation during this phase. These adaptations increase sleep pressure tolerance and are driven by the maturation of physiological, psychological, and cognitive functioning along with delays in circadian rhythmicity, thus creating an environment for inadequate sleep during adolescence. As such, the adolescent period is a phase of rapid growth and maturation that presents multiple challenges to both sleep and nutrition; consequently, this places a significant burden on an adolescent athletes' ability to recover, thus increasing the likelihood of injury.

The common view is thus that sleep represents a collection of discrete states with distinct neurophysiological signatures. However, recent findings challenge such a monolithic view of sleep. Indeed, there can be sharp discrepancies in time and space in the activity displayed by different brain regions or networks, making it difficult to assign a global vigilance state to such a mosaic of contrasted dynamics. Viewing sleep as a multidimensional continuum rather than a succession of non-overlapping and mutually exclusive states could account for these local aspects of sleep. Moving away from the focus on sleep states, sleep can also be investigated through the brain processes that are present in sleep, if not necessarily specific to sleep.

Eye movements recorded during REM sleep have not been consistently reported to mirror the eye movements predicted by dream reports.

The assumption that dreaming occurs only in REM sleep is incorrect, with numerous reports of nonREM dreaming. However, there may be qualitative differences between REM and nonREM dreams. Early studies that suggested a vital role for REM sleep in psychological well-being are refuted by studies of pharmacologically induced partial or complete REM sleep suppression. Studies of sleep across species show that the primitive monotreme mammals, platypus and echidna, have far more REM sleep than any other homeotherm group, whereas birds have far less REM sleep than any other homeotherm group. Human REM sleep amounts are not unusual, are correlated with nonREM sleep durations but are not correlated with intelligence. Across groups of homeotherms, REM sleep time is highly and inversely correlated (r=-0.975, P=0.02) with average core body temperature, suggesting that REM sleep cycles with nonREM sleep to regulate brain temperature during sleep. Cetacean mammals (dolphins and whales) do not have REM sleep despite their very large brain sizes and impressive cognitive abilities. Reports of \"REM sleep-like states\" in arachnids, cephalopods and in zebrafish larvae are lacking critical evidence that the observed behaviors are occurring during sleep and that the behaviors are homologous to mammalian REM sleep.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37625974/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "37524037", "Title": "Rapid eye movement sleep loss associated cytomorphometric changes and neurodegeneration.", "Abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is essential for leading normal healthy living at least in higher-order mammals, including humans. In this review, we briefly survey the available literature for evidence linking cytomorphometric changes in the brain due to loss of REMS. As a mechanism of action, we add evidence that REMS loss elevates noradrenaline (NA) levels in the brain, which affects neuronal cytomorphology. These changes may be a compensatory mechanism as the changes return to normal after the subjects recover from the loss of REMS or if during REMS deprivation, the subjects are treated with NA-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (PRZ). We had proposed earlier that one of the fundamental functions of REMS is to maintain the level of NA in the brain. We elaborate on this idea to propose that if REMS loss continues without recovery, the sustained level of NA breaks down neurophysiologically active compensatory mechanism/s starting with changes in the neuronal cytomorphology, followed by their degeneration, leading to acute and chronic pathological conditions. Identification of neuronal cytomorphological changes could prove to be of significance for predicting future neuronal (brain) damage as well as an indicator for REMS health. Although current brain imaging techniques may not enable us to visualize changes in neuronal cytomorphology, given the rapid technological progress including use of artificial intelligence, we are optimistic that it may be a reality soon.

However, real-life memories often live in rich, complex networks of associations. In this review, we will examine recent forays into investigating how targeted sleep reactivation affects memories within complex paradigms, in which one cue can reactivate multiple tested memories.

We therefore emphasize how intricate study design details that alter the nature of learning and/or participant intentions impact the outcomes of sleep reactivation. In some cases, complex networks of memories interact harmoniously to bring about mutual memory benefits; in other cases, memories interact antagonistically and produce selective impairments in retrieval.

Cognitive decline (and, to a lesser extent, normal ageing) are associated with sleep fragmentation and loss of slow-wave sleep. Evidence suggests a bidirectional causal link between these losses. Phase-locked auditory stimulation has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool to enhance slow-wave sleep, potentially ameliorating cognitive decline. In laboratory settings, auditory stimulation is usually supervised by trained experts. Different algorithms (simple amplitude thresholds, topographic correlation, sine-wave fitting, phase-locked loop, and phase vocoder) are used to precisely target auditory stimulation to a desired phase of the slow wave. While all algorithms work well in younger adults, the altered sleep physiology of older adults and particularly those with neurodegenerative disorders requires a tailored approach that can adapt to older adults' fragmented sleep and reduced amplitudes of slow waves.

Temporally, dynamic switching prevails around state transitions, during extended wakefulness, and in fragmented sleep.

Self-reported sleep duration was categorized as short (<7 h/d), normal (7-9 h/d) and long (>9 h/d). Self-reported chronotype was categories as \"definitely morning\" or \"definitely evening.\" Analysis included 3903 middle-aged adults: 929 short, 2924 normal and 50 long sleepers; with 966 definitely-morning and 355 definitely-evening chronotypes. Long sleep was independently associated with lower left ventricular (LV) mass (-4.8%, P\u202f=\u202f0.035), left atrial maximum volume (-8.1%, P\u202f=\u202f0.041) and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-4.8%, P\u202f=\u202f0.038) compared to those with normal sleep duration.

Acute sleep deprivation and more chronic sleep restriction adversely affect individual health, impairing memory and cognitive performance as well as increasing the risk and progression of numerous diseases. In mammals, the hippocampus and hippocampus-dependent memory are vulnerable to the effects of acute sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation induces changes in molecular signaling, gene expression and may cause changes in dendritic structure in neurons. Genome wide studies have shown that acute sleep deprivation alters gene transcription, although the pool of genes affected varies between brain regions. More recently, advances in research have drawn attention to differences in gene regulation between the level of the transcriptome compared with the pool of mRNA associated with ribosomes for protein translation following sleep deprivation. Thus, in addition to transcriptional changes, sleep deprivation also affects downstream processes to alter protein translation. In this review, we focus on the multiple levels through which acute sleep deprivation impacts gene regulation, highlighting potential post-transcriptional and translational processes that may be affected by sleep deprivation.

Sleep analysis is commonly performed based on self-rating indices, sleep duration, environmental factors, physiologically and polysomnographic-derived parameters, and the occurrence of disorders. However, the correlation that has been observed between the subjective assessment and objective measurements of sleep quality is small. Recently, a few automated systems have been suugested to measure sleep quality to address this challenge. Sleep quality can be assessed by evaluating macrostructure-based sleep analysis via the examination of sleep cycles, namely Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) with N1, N2, and N3 stages. However, macrostructure sleep analysis does not consider transitory phenomena like K-complexes and transient fluctuations, which are indispensable in diagnosing various sleep disorders. The CAP, part of the microstructure of sleep, may offer a more precise and relevant examination of sleep and can be considered one of the candidates to measure sleep quality and identify sleep disorders such as insomnia and apnea. CAP is characterized by very subtle changes in the brain's electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that occur during the NREM stage of sleep. The variations among these patterns in healthy subjects and subjects with sleep disorders can be used to identify sleep disorders. Studying CAP is highly arduous for human experts; thus, developing automated systems for assessing CAP is gaining momentum. Developing new techniques for automated CAP detection installed in clinical setups is essential. This paper aims to analyze the algorithms and methods presented in the literature for the automatic assessment of CAP and the development of CAP-based sleep markers that may enhance sleep quality assessment, helping diagnose sleep disorders.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037163/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "36959079", "Title": "Memory reactivations during sleep: a neural basis of dream experiences?", "Abstract": "Newly encoded memory traces are spontaneously reactivated during sleep.

This systematic review discusses the relevant methods and technologies for non-contact monitoring of cardiorespiratory activity during sleep. Taking into account the current state of the art in non-intrusive technologies, we can identify the methods of non-intrusive monitoring of cardiac and respiratory activity, the technologies and types of sensors used, and the possible physiological parameters available for analysis.

Publications were assessed using one main question and several specific questions. We obtained 3774 unique articles from four literature databases (Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and checked them for relevance, resulting in 54 articles that were analysed in a structured way using terminology. The result was 15 different types of sensors and devices (e.g., radar, temperature sensors, motion sensors, cameras) that can be installed in hospital wards and departments or in the environment. The ability to detect heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep disorders such as apnoea was among the characteristics examined to investigate the overall effectiveness of the systems and technologies considered for cardiorespiratory monitoring. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the considered systems and technologies were identified by answering the identified research questions.

Bridging the gap between brain and phenomenology of (un)conscious experience, we propose the Topographic-dynamic Re-organization model of Dreams (TRoD). Topographically, dreams are characterized by a shift towards increased activity and connectivity in the default-mode network (DMN) while they are reduced in the central executive network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (except in lucid dreaming). This topographic re-organization is accompanied by dynamic changes; a shift towards slower frequencies and longer timescales. This puts dreams dynamically in an intermediate position between awake state and NREM 2/SWS sleep. TRoD proposes that the shift towards DMN and slower frequencies leads to an abnormal spatiotemporal framing of input processing including both internally- and externally-generated inputs (from body and environment).\u00a0In dreams, a shift away from temporal segregation to temporal integration\u00a0of inputs results in the often bizarre and highly self-centric mental contents as well as hallucinatory-like states.

A major concern associated with aging is the changes in health that can lead to various diseases such as cancer and neurogenerative diseases, which are major burdens on individuals and societies. Thus, it is imperative to better understand changes in sleep and circadian rhythms that accompany aging to improve the health of an older population and target diseases associated with aging. Circadian rhythms play a role in most physiological processes and can contribute to age-related diseases. Interestingly, there is a relationship between circadian rhythms and aging. For example, many older adults have a shift in chronotype, which is an individual's natural inclination to sleep certain times of the day. As adults age, most people tend to go to sleep earlier while also waking up earlier. Numerous studies also suggest that disrupted circadian rhythms may be indicative of developing age-related diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.

Here, hippocampal replay likely favors the transformation of hippocampus-dependent episodic memory into schema-like neocortical memory. REM sleep following SWS might balance local synaptic rescaling accompanying memory transformation with a sleep-dependent homeostatic process of global synaptic renormalization.

Dreaming is a strange physiological phenomenon. Research has demonstrated that dreaming is closely associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It is known that dreaming also occurs during non-REM (NREM) sleep, but the content appears to be different. Dreams during REM sleep tend to be longer, more vivid, more story-like, and more bizarre than those during NREM sleep. In this review, the neural circuits underlying dreaming and the physiological functions associated with it are summarized. Two major theories have been proposed regarding the neural circuits involved in dreaming. One is that dreams are generated by the activation of neural activity in the brainstem and its signal transmission to the cortex.

Our aim is to i) contextualise the phenomenon, ii) propose an operating definition, and iii) summarise the scientific approaches used so far. The literature review identified 17 studies on self-awakening. Most of them adopted an objective sleep evaluation (76%), targeted nocturnal sleep (76%), and used a single criterion to define the success of awakening (82%); for most studies, this corresponded to awakening occurring in a time window of 30 minutes around the expected awakening time.

We propose that the high levels of melatonin secreted by the pineal gland directly into the CSF play a role in flushing pathological molecules such as amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) from the brain via this network. Melatonin is a sleep-promoting agent, with waste clearance from the CNS being highest especially during slow wave sleep. Melatonin is also a potent and versatile antioxidant that prevents neural accumulation of oxidatively-damaged molecules which contribute to neurological decline. Due to its feedback actions on the suprachiasmatic nucleus, CSF melatonin rhythm functions to maintain optimal circadian rhythmicity, which is also critical for preserving neurocognitive health. Melatonin levels drop dramatically in the frail aged, potentially contributing to neurological failure and dementia. Melatonin supplementation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) defers A\u03b2 accumulation, enhances its clearance from the CNS, and prolongs animal survival. In AD patients, preliminary data show that melatonin use reduces neurobehavioral signs such as sundowning.

Pathophysiological insights and nosological considerations.", "Abstract": "Encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES) is a childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by the appearance of cognitive, behavioral, and motor disturbances in conjunction with a striking activation of EEG epileptic abnormalities during non-REM sleep. After more than 50\u00a0years since the first description, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the appearance of encephalopathy in association with a sleep-related enhancement of epileptic discharges are incompletely elucidated. Recent experimental data support the hypothesis that the development of the ESES encephalopathic picture depends on a spike-induced impairment of the synaptic homeostasis processes occurring during normal sleep and that is particularly pronounced during the developmental age. During sleep, synaptic homeostasis is promoted by synaptic weakening/elimination after the increment of synaptic strength that occurs during wakefulness. The EEG can display modifications in synaptic strength by changes in sleep slow wave activity (SWA). Recent studies during active ESES have failed to show changes in sleep SWA, while these changes occurred again after recovery from ESES, thus supporting a spike-related interference on the normal homeostatic processes of sleep. This impairment, during the developmental period, can lead to disruption of cortical wiring and brain plastic remodeling, which lead to the, often irreversible, neuropsychological compromise typical of ESES. From the nosographic point of view, these pathophysiological data lend support to the maintenance of the term ESES, i.e., \"encephalopathy related to status epilepticus during sleep\". Indeed, this term conveys the concept that the extreme activation of epileptic discharges during sleep is directly responsible for the encephalopathy, hence the importance of defining this condition as an encephalopathy related to the exaggerated activation of epileptic activity during sleep. In this respect, ESES represents a genuine example of a \"pure\" epileptic encephalopathy in which sleep-related epileptic activity \"per se\" has a crucial role in determining the encephalopathic picture.

However, a paralyzed form of spinal-rhombencephalic wakefulness remains in mammals in the form of REMS, whose phasic signs are highly efficient in promoting maternal care to mammalian litter. Therefore, the phasic REMS is highly adaptive. However, their importance is low for singletons, in which it is a neutral trait, devoid of adaptive value for adults, and is mal-adaptive for marine mammals. Therefore, they lost it. The spinal-rhombencephalic and cortical wakeful states disregard the homeostasis: animals only attend their most immediate needs: foraging defense and reproduction. However, these activities generate allostatic loads that must be recovered during NREMS, that is a paralyzed form of the amphibian-reptilian subcortical wakefulness. Regarding the regulation of tonic REMS, it depends on a hypothalamic switch. Instead, the phasic REMS depends on an independent proportional pontine control.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36646258/", "Qualifers": ["physiology"]}, {"PMID": "36572659", "Title": "The effect of wearable-delivered sleep interventions on sleep outcomes among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.", "Abstract": "The aims of the review were to (i) evaluate the effectiveness of wearable-delivered sleep interventions on sleep outcomes among adults, and (ii) explore the effect of factors affecting total sleep time.

Despite this broad spanning influence, ripples remain capable of producing precise memories. The underlying mechanisms that enable ripples to consolidate memories broadly and with specificity across experiences remain unknown. In this review, we discuss data that uncovers circuit-level processes that generate ripples and influence their characteristics during consolidation.

Decades of research have shown the inconsistent effects of SD on depression, focusing on SD duration. However, inconsistent role of SD seems to be more complicated, and SD duration cannot be the only one factor. Regarding this issue, we chose some important factors involved in the effects of SD on cognitive functions and mood including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), serotonin, cortisol, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). It was concluded that SD has a wide-range of inconsistent effects on BDNF, VEGF, serotonin, and cortisol levels. It was noted that BDNF diurnal rhythm is significantly involved in the modulatory role of SD in depression. Furthermore, the important role of VEGF in blood-brain barrier permeability which is involved in modulating depression was discussed. It was also noted that there is a negative correlation between cortisol and BDNF that modulates depression.

Disturbances to sleep patterns impart widespread and adverse effects on numerous cells, tissues, and organs. Insufficient sleep causes circadian misalignment in humans, including perturbed peripheral clocks, leading to disrupted skeletal muscle and liver metabolism, and whole-body energy homeostasis. Fragmented or insufficient sleep also perturbs the hormonal milieu, shifting it towards a catabolic state, resulting in reduced rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The interaction between disrupted sleep and skeletal muscle metabolic health is complex, with the mechanisms underpinning sleep-related disturbances on this tissue often multifaceted. Strategies to promote sufficient sleep duration combined with the appropriate timing of meals and physical activity to maintain circadian rhythmicity are important to mitigate the adverse effects of inadequate sleep on whole-body and skeletal muscle metabolic health.

The behaviour of a post-parasitoid-egressed host resembles a quiescence state with a characteristic reduction in motor activities like feeding, locomotion, respiration, and metabolic rate. Yet, they respond aggressively through a defensive response when disturbed, which ensures better fitness for the parasitoid's offspring. The behavioural changes in the parasitized host appear after the parasitoid egression. Several hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate how the parasitized host's behaviour is manipulated for the fitness benefits of the inducers, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. We review evidence to explain the behavioural changes and their mechanism in the parasitized hosts. The evidence suggests that parasitoid pre-pupal egression may drive the host to stress-induced sleep. The elevated octopamine concentration also reflects the stress response in the host. Given the theoretical links between the behavioural and the physiological changes in the post-parasitoid-egressed host and stress-induced sleep of other invertebrates, we suggest that behavioural studies combined with functional genomics, proteomics, and histological analyses might give a better understanding of bodyguard manipulation.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36448293/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "36094530", "Title": "Nonpharmacological Interventions to Lengthen Sleep Duration in Healthy Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Adequate sleep duration is necessary for many aspects of child health, development, and well-being, yet sleep durations for children are declining, and effective strategies to increase sleep in healthy children remain to be elucidated.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094530/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "35963360", "Title": "Adolescent sleep and the foundations of prefrontal cortical development and dysfunction.", "Abstract": "Modern life poses many threats to good-quality sleep, challenging brain health across the lifespan.

This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy and acceptability between blue-wavelength light therapy (BWLT) and long-wavelength/no light therapy (LW/NLT) for post-TBI sleepiness, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and fatigue.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36201498/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "36325787", "Title": "[Advances in Mechanisms of Blood Brain Barrier Impairment Induced by Sleep Deprivation].", "Abstract": "Sleep deprivation,the process and state of partial or complete lack of normal sleep caused by various factors,is prevalent at present.Seriously impairing the physical and mental health,sleep deprivation has become a public health problem that cannot be ignored.Studies have demonstrated that blood-brain barrier impairment is the key pathophysiological process of a variety of neurological diseases.Although clinical and basic studies have suggested that sleep deprivation can induce blood-brain barrier impairment,the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.This review summarizes the advances in the mechanisms of blood-brain barrier impairment induced by sleep deprivation.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36325787/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "36207108", "Title": "Role of Psychologists in Pediatric Sleep Medicine.", "Abstract": "Sleep disorders commonly afflict infants, children, and adolescents and have a significant adverse impact on them and their families, sometimes to a severe degree. They can cause immediate stress and suffering and long-term loss of opportunities and potential. Many of these disorders can be well managed by the psychologist and often one is required, either as the sole provider or as an integral part of a team. Sleep disorders have a bidirectional interplay with mental health disorders. The patient may therefore present initially to the psychologist, primary care provider, or the sleep medicine specialist.", "Year": "2022", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36207108/", "Qualifers": []}]}}
