Some propose treatment for this indication, based on observational data, while others argue against because of the lack of randomised trial evidence.

Nine observational studies report significantly lower cardiovascular event rates in those treated, than in those not treated, for SDB. Conversely, 12 randomised trials in which excessive daytime sleepiness was generally an exclusion criterion showed no reduction in cardiovascular event rates. The SERVE-HF trial showed an increase in mortality with use of minute ventilation-triggered adaptive servo-ventilation for CSA in patients with HFrEF. In the ADVENT-HF trial, treating HFrEF patients with coexisting OSA or CSA using peak flow-triggered adaptive servo-ventilation was safe and improved sleep structure and heart failure-related quality of life but did not reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events.

Obstructive sleep apnea is typified by intermittent airway blockages which results in low oxygen levels and disrupted sleep. These two conditions often coexist, with each worsening the other. Understanding this connection is critical to improve diagnosis and treatment. The relationship between atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea appears bidirectional. Obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of atrial fibrillation through various mechanisms which are arrhythmogenic. Conversely, patients with atrial fibrillation are more likely to have undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, complicating their treatment. Screening modalities for obstructive sleep apnea are often inadequate. Polysomnography remains the most reliable tool but is costly and not practical for routine screening of all patients which limits early diagnosis and management. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and can reduce atrial fibrillation recurrence by decreasing oxygen deprivation and sympathetic activity. However, adherence to continuous positive airway pressure is often low due to patient discomfort. Alternative therapies, such as mandibular advancement devices and hypoglossal nerve stimulation, offer promising options for patients who cannot tolerate continuous positive airway pressure.

In simple terms, LG measures how the respiratory control system reacts to changes in breathing. A high LG suggests that minor disturbances in breathing prompt exaggerated responses, potentially leading to instability and oscillations in respiratory patterns. Conversely, a low LG implies that the system responds more gently to disturbances, resulting in stable and well-regulated breathing. However, understanding the concept of loop gain presents challenges due to its dynamic nature across various sleep respiratory disorders, sleep stages, positions, and interactions with other pathophysiological traits. Recent efforts have aimed to identify a non-invasive method for assessing LG, with some evidence suggesting that information regarding pathophysiological traits can be extracted from polysomnography. There exists a clinical imperative for physician to unravel the intricacies of LG when managing Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients, because LG abnormalities delineate a distinct pathophysiological phenotype of OSA. Specifically, certain patients exhibit a high LG as the primary factor driving sleep apnea, influencing treatment outcomes. For instance, individuals with high LG may respond differently to therapies such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or oral appliances compared to those with normal LG, or they can be treated with specific drugs or combination therapies.

Sympathetic activity due to intermittent hypoxia and/or fragmented sleep is the most important mechanisms triggering the elevation in blood pressure in OSA. OSA-related hypertension is characterized by resistant hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, abnormal blood pressure variability, and vascular remodeling. In particular, the prevalence of OSA is high in patients with resistant hypertension, and the mechanism proposed includes vascular remodeling due to the exacerbation of arterial stiffness by OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is effective at lowering blood pressure, however, the magnitude of the decrease in blood pressure is relatively modest, therefore, patients often need to also take antihypertensive medications to achieve optimal blood pressure control. Antihypertensive medications targeting sympathetic pathways or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have theoretical potential in OSA-related hypertension, Therefore, beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may be effective in the management of OSA-related hypertension, but current evidence is limited. The characteristics of OSA-related hypertension, such as nocturnal hypertension and obesity-related hypertension, suggests potential for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor/ glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA). Recently, OSA has been considered to be caused not only by upper airway anatomy but also by several non-anatomic mechanisms, such as responsiveness of the upper airway response, ventilatory control instability, and reduced sleep arousal threshold. Elucidating the phenotypic mechanisms of OSA may potentially advance more personalized hypertension treatment strategies in the future.

This phenomenon is particularly significant in patients with HF due to impaired cardiovascular function leading to fluid retention. The repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep triggers abrupt changes in intrathoracic pressure negatively impacting cardiac tissue remodeling by promoting inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, sleep fragmentation and arousals activate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), imposing additional strain on the cardiovascular system. Accumulated data suggest that rostral fluid shifts are a clinically significant pathomechanism in the coexistence of OSA and HF. Therapeutic strategies, including the benefits of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and lifestyle modifications, have been discussed.

The gold standard for diagnosing OSA is polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG has several drawbacks, for example, it is a cumbersome and expensive procedure, which can be quite inconvenient for patients. Additionally, patients often have to endure long waitlists before they can undergo PSG. As a result, other alternatives for screening OSA have gained attention. Speech, as an accessible modality, is generated by variations in the pharyngeal airway, vocal tract, and soft tissues in the pharynx, which shares similar anatomical structures that contribute to OSA. Consequently, in this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the existing research on the use of speech for estimating the severity of OSA.

Potential mechanisms are proposed, including the role of vitamin D deficiency in promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, impairing immune function, muscle function, and gene polymorphism of vitamin D receptors, all of which could contribute to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. The paper underscores the need for future research to validate these observations, to determine optimal vitamin D supplementation dosage and duration, to explore potential side effects and risks, and to investigate potential interactions with other treatments.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38414320/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "39293885", "Title": "Treatment of OSA and its Impact on Cardiovascular Disease, Part 2: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.", "Abstract": "Many studies have shown an association of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with incident cardiovascular diseases, particularly when comorbid with insomnia, excessive sleepiness, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The gold standard treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA is positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Practice guidelines by the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine have recommended preoperative screening for OSA and consideration of initiation of PAP therapy for patients with severe OSA. These guidelines, developed mainly by the consensus of experts, highlight the adverse impact of OSA on postoperative outcomes and recommend the use of postoperative PAP in surgical patients with moderate to severe OSA. Since the development of these guidelines, there has been an increase in the number of publications regarding the efficacy of PAP therapy in surgical patients with OSA. Our review provides an update on the existing literature on the efficacy of PAP therapy in surgical patients with OSA. We focus on the postoperative complications associated with OSA, potential mechanisms leading to the increased risk of postoperative adverse events, and summarize the perioperative guidelines for the management of patients with OSA, evidence supporting perioperative PAP therapy, as well as limitations to PAP therapy and alternatives.

Potential sequelae of untreated SDB includes failure to thrive, cardiopulmonary disease, impaired learning and behavioural issues. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of SDB is important to facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes.The current gold-standard diagnostic test for SDB is polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive, requiring the interpretation of a highly specialised physiologist. PSG is not feasible in low-income countries or outwith specialist sleep centres. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, efforts were made to improve remote monitoring and diagnostics in paediatric sleep medicine, resulting in a paradigm shift in SDB technology with a focus on automated diagnosis harnessing artificial intelligence (AI).

Therapeutic efficacy and its impact on outcomes, particularly for cardiovascular consequences, may also vary depending on these features in obstructive sleep apnea. A number of interventions such as positive airway pressure therapies, oral appliance, surgical treatment, and pharmaceutical options are available in clinical practice. Selecting an effective obstructive sleep apnea treatment and therapy is a challenging medical decision due to obstructive sleep apnea heterogeneity and numerous treatment modalities. Thus, an objective marker for clinical evaluation is warranted to estimate the treatment response in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

Regarding treatment, positive airway pressure devices used to ameliorate symptoms in SDB also seem to result in a reduction of MR severity, MR jet fraction and an improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction. However, surgical and transcatheter interventions for MR, and especially transcatheter edge to edge mitral valve repair (TEER), seem to also have a positive effect on SDB, by reducing OSA and CSA-related severity indexes and improving symptom control. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the common pathophysiology between SDB and MR, as well as to discuss the available evidence regarding the effect of SDB treatment on MR and the effect of mitral valve surgery or transcatheter repair on both OSA and CSA.", "Year": "2024", "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38029624/", "Qualifers": ["complications", "therapy", "diagnosis"]}, {"PMID": "37953019", "Title": "Novel Approaches to Sleep Apnea in Heart Failure.", "Abstract": "Sleep apnea is a serious comorbid condition affecting patients with heart failure.

The most frequent form of hypoxia occurring in human development is chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) due to sleep-disordered breathing (apnea) or bradycardia events. CIH incidence is particularly high with premature infants. During CIH, repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation initiate oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades in the brain. A dense microvascular network of arterioles, capillaries, and venules is required to support the constant metabolic demands of the adult brain. The development and refinement of this microvasculature is orchestrated throughout gestation and in the initial weeks after birth, at a critical juncture when CIH can occur. There is little knowledge on how CIH affects the development of the cerebrovasculature. However, since CIH (and its treatments) can cause profound abnormalities in tissue oxygen content and neural activity, there is reason to believe that it can induce lasting abnormalities in vascular structure and function at the microvascular level contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders.

Obesity favours upper airway collapsibility, but other pathophysiological traits have been identified, i.e. upper airway muscle activity, modulation of the respiratory drive, and the arousal threshold. OSA causes chronic intermittent hypoxia, inflammatory activation and autonomic imbalance with diurnal and nocturnal sympathetic hyperactivity. Disentangling so many components to investigate the pathogenesis of OSA's consequences is very hard clinically. However, albeit imperfect, clinical medicine constitutes a major source of inspiration for basic research, and a mutual exchange of information is essential between clinicians and physiologists to improve our understanding of disease states. OSA is no exception, and this narrative review will summarize the results of clinical studies performed over the years by the European Sleep Apnoea Database (ESADA) Study Group, to explore the variables linked to markers of intermittent hypoxia as opposed to the traditional assessment of OSA severity based on the frequency of respiratory events during sleep (the Apnoea Hypopnoea Index). The results of the clinical studies indicate that intermittent hypoxia variables are associated with several comorbidities, although evidence of a cause-effect relationship is still missing in many cases.

The pathological cardiorespiratory consequences of OSA have been attributed to systemic oxidative stress, inflammation and sympathetic overflow induced by CIH, but an emerging body of evidence indicates that a nitro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory milieu within the carotid body (CB) is involved in the potentiation of CB chemosensory responses to hypoxia, which contribute to enhance the sympathetic activity. Accordingly, autonomic and cardiovascular alterations induced by CIH are critically dependent on an abnormally heightened CB chemosensory input to the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS), where second-order neurons project onto the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), activating pre-sympathetic neurons that control pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons. CIH produces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the NTS and RVLM, which may contribute to the long-term irreversibility of the CIH-induced alterations. This brief review is mainly focused on the contribution of nitro-oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory molecules on the hyperactivation of the hypoxic chemoreflex pathway including the CB and the brainstem centres, and whether the persistence of autonomic and cardiorespiratory alterations may depend on the glial-related neuroinflammation induced by the enhanced CB chemosensory afferent input.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Review", "Journal Article"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37119020/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "37029496", "Title": "Carotid body hypersensitivity in intermittent hypoxia and obtructive sleep apnoea.", "Abstract": "Carotid bodies are the principal sensory organs for detecting changes in arterial blood oxygen concentration, and the carotid body chemoreflex is a major regulator of the sympathetic tone, blood pressure and breathing.

This cycle is controlled by an internal biological clock that is present in the body's tissues and helps regulate various processes such as sleeping, eating, and others. Interestingly, animal models have provided enough evidence to assume that the alteration in the circadian system leads to the appearance of numerous diseases. Alterations in breathing patterns in lung diseases can modify oxygenation and the circadian cycles; however, the response mechanisms to hypoxia and their relationship with the clock genes are not fully understood. Hypoxia is a condition in which the lack of adequate oxygenation promotes adaptation mechanisms and is related to several genes that regulate the circadian cycles, the latter because hypoxia alters the production of melatonin and brain physiology. Additionally, the lack of oxygen alters the expression of clock genes, leading to an alteration in the regularity and precision of the circadian cycle. In this sense, hypoxia is a hallmark of a wide variety of lung diseases.

Among sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) appears to be a potentially interesting comorbidity, as it is highly prevalent in the middle-aged and elderly population, often associated with some cognitive impairment, associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia including AD, and indeed treatable. The association between OSA and cognition varies according to the studies, but OSA is more frequent in older people with AD than those who are cognitively normal. People with OSA suffer from daytime sleepiness, impaired cognitive function and an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, dementia and AD than those without OSA. Finally, the literature suggests a link between OSA and AD biomarkers. Whether screening and treating OSA could have positive impact on the levels of AD biomarkers and slow or even prevent incident dementia remain to be investigated. It therefore seems essential to understand the role of OSA in the pathophysiology of AD, as there is still no effective treatment to slow or halt its progression.

SWD are frequent following stroke, with sleep apnea (SA) being the most frequent SWD affecting more than half of stroke survivors. While sleep disturbances and SWD are frequently reported in the acute phase, they may persist in the chronic phase after an ischemic stroke. Despite the frequency and risk associated with SWD following stroke, screening for SWD remains rare in the clinical setting, due to challenges in the assessment of post-stroke SWD, uncertainty regarding the optimal timing for their diagnosis, and a lack of clear treatment guidelines (i.e., when to treat and the optimal treatment strategy). However, little evidence support the feasibility of SWD treatment even in the acute phase of stroke and its favorable effect on long-term cardiovascular and functional outcomes. Thus, sleep health recommendations and SWD treatment should be systematically embedded in secondary stroke prevention strategy. We therefore propose that the management of SWD associated with stroke should rely on a multidisciplinary approach, with an integrated diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up strategy.

Positive airway pressure therapy has the potential to benefit these patients but can be challenging in this population. Our primary aim was to describe positive pressure therapy adherence. Secondarily, we aimed at identifying identify predictors of adherence to treatment in adults with neurodegenerative diseases and OSA, and report the effect of PAP adherence on outcomes such as cognitive function, quality of life and patient/caregiver satisfaction. We performed a systematic review of the literature and identified seventeen studies, eight reporting on adults with obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 3 with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Meta-analyses were not performed due to lack of systematic and standardized reporting of the primary outcome. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to an average of 3.3 years. PAP adherence definition was widely variable between studies. Attrition rates ranged from 12% to 75%. In MCI/AD, adherence rates ranged from 28% to 61% (study duration range: 3 weeks to 3.3 years). Younger age, race (white) and better CPAP confidence scores at 1 week were associated with more CPAP use while APOE4 positive and unmarried individuals were more likely to abandon CPAP. In most studies, adherent patients had improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, ability to manage daily activities and certain aspects of cognition (composite score or global cognition, psychomotor speed, executive function), as well as less cognitive decline over time. Caregiver satisfaction was also better in PAP adherent patients in one study. In PD, 15-25% of individuals refused treatment with PAP upfront, and attrition ranged from 8 to 75%. Adherent patients used their device for an average of 3h27 to 5h12 per night (study duration range: 6 weeks to 12 months). Longer disease duration, worse motor symptoms or sleep quality and lower % of REM sleep were identified as predictors of lower PAP adherence in a preliminary study, while race (non-white) and sex (women) were linked to lower adherence in a large retrospective study. In the study reporting the highest attrition rate (75%), individuals had lower educational levels. PAP adherence improved daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, sleep architecture and quality and global non-motor symptoms. However, in one short-term (3 weeks) study, there was no improvement in neuropsychological testing composite score. Three studies on MSA patients suffering from sleep-disordered breathing showed that most patients are accepting of PAP (69-72%) with an average nightly use of 4h42 to 6h18. Floppy epiglottis was more frequently seen in patients discontinuing PAP in one study. In one study, four adults with MSA and long-term PAP use reported better sleep and improved vigilance. Survival time was no different between treated and untreated individuals. In conclusion, PAP therapy is challenging in patients with OSA and NDD, as evidenced by the considerable attrition and low adherence rates reported in this systematic review. There is emerging evidence proposing OSA a treatable target to prevent clinical and functional deterioration in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and addressing potential barriers to PAP adherence is paramount to maximize adherence. Our systematic review outlines several of these potential barriers, underscoring the need for future studies to standardize the definition of and explore long-term adherence to PAP therapy and assess interventions that can optimize adherence in this patient population.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Systematic Review", "Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37586145/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "37560987", "Title": "Established and potential cardiovascular risk factors in metabolic syndrome: Effect of bariatric surgery.", "Abstract": "The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the role of novel biomarkers in metabolic syndrome, their association with cardiovascular risk and the impact of bariatric surgery on these biomarkers.", "Year": "2023", "PublicationType": ["Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37560987/", "Qualifers": []}, {"PMID": "37541789", "Title": "Obstructive sleep apnea in Parkinson's disease: A prevalent, clinically relevant and treatable feature.", "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common comorbid sleep disorder. The prevalence of OSA in PD is high, and its impact on quality of life, accident risk, and limited treatment options underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and effective interventions. OSA is observed in 20-70% of PD patients, whereas the general population exhibits a lower prevalence ranging from 2 to 14%. These discrepancies in prevalence may be attributed to differences in demographic characteristics, sample sizes with selection bias, and variations in scoring systems for apnea and hypopnea events used across different studies. This review highlights the potential pathogenesis of comorbid OSA in PD and provides an overview of ongoing clinical trials investigating interventions for this condition. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of OSA in PD, including intermittent hypoxemia, sleep fragmentation, alterations in the glymphatic system homeostasis, upper airway obstruction, and inflammation. Given the adverse effects of PD comorbid OSA, early intervention measures are crucial. It is imperative to conduct longitudinal studies and clinical trials to elucidate the pathogenesis and develop novel and effective interventions for OSA in PD patients.

Its multiple associated comorbidities contribute to a decreased quality of life and work performance as well as an increased risk of death. Standard treatment seems to have limited effects on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of the disease, emphasising the need for early diagnosis and additional therapeutic approaches. Recent evidence suggests that the dysregulation of circadian rhythms, processes with endogenous rhythmicity that are adjusted to the environment through various cues, is involved in the pathogenesis of comorbidities. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, altered circadian gene expression patterns have been demonstrated. Obstructive respiratory events may promote circadian dysregulation through the effects of sleep disturbance and intermittent hypoxia, with subsequent inflammation and disruption of neural and hormonal homeostasis. In this review, current knowledge on obstructive sleep apnea, circadian rhythm regulation, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders is summarised. Studies that connect obstructive sleep apnea to circadian rhythm abnormalities are critically evaluated. Furthermore, pathogenetic mechanisms that may underlie this association, most notably hypoxia signalling, are presented. A bidirectional relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm dysregulation is proposed.

These overall null findings might be explained by limitations in trial design and low levels of adherence to CPAP.

This condition can be classified as either central (CSA) or obstructive (OSA) sleep apnea, with the latest being the most common and toxic. Due to the complexity of living organisms, animal models and, particularly, mice still represent an essential tool for the study of SBD. In the present review we first discuss the methodological pros and cons in the use of whole-body plethysmography to coupling respiratory and sleep measurements and to characterize CSA and OSA in mice; then, we draw an updated and objective picture of the methods used so far in the study of sleep apnea in mice. Most of the studies present in the literature used intermittent hypoxia to mimic OSA in mice and to investigate consequent pathological correlates. On the contrary, few studies using genetic manipulation or high-fat diets investigated the pathogenesis or potential treatments of sleep apnea. To date, mice lacking orexins, hemeoxygenase-2, monoamine oxidase A, Phox2b or Cdkl5 can be considered validated mouse models of sleep apnea. Moreover, genetically- or diet-induced obese mice, and mice recapitulating Down syndrome were proposed as OSA models.

We searched for available articles for the time period from 2013 to 2023. Obesity is listed as one of the most important health issues. Complications of obesity, with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) listed among them, are common problems in clinical practice. Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for OSA, but OSA itself may contribute to worsening obesity. Bariatric surgery is a treatment of choice for severely obese patients, especially with present complications, and remains the only causative treatment for patients with OSA. Though improvement in OSA control in patients after bariatric surgery is well-established knowledge, the complete resolution of OSA is achieved in less than half of them. The determination of subpopulations of patients in whom bariatric surgery would be especially advantageous is an important issue of OSA management.

Accumulating evidence suggests an association between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease independent of the traditionally recognized cardiovascular disease risk factors. Observational studies indicate that obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease and that alleviation of obstructive events with positive airway pressure may improve cardiovascular disease outcomes. However, recent randomized controlled trials have not supported the beneficial effect of positive airway pressure in cardiac populations with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea. Some evidence suggests that the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and traditionally recognized cardiovascular disease risk factors is bidirectional, suggesting that patients with cardiovascular disease may also develop obstructive sleep apnea and that efficient treatment of cardiovascular disease may improve obstructive sleep apnea. Recent data also indicate that the apnea-hypopnea index, which is commonly used as a diagnostic measure of obstructive sleep apnea severity, has limited value as a prognostic measure for cardiovascular disease outcomes. Novel markers of obstructive sleep apnea-associated hypoxic burden and cardiac autonomic response seem to be strong predictors of adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes and response to treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. This narrative review and position paper from the Turkish Collaboration of Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Trialists aims to update the current evidence about the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease and, consequently, raise awareness for health professionals who deal with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to improve the ability to direct resources at patients most likely to benefit from treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and optimize treatment of the coexisting cardiovascular diseases.

Addressing this issue, the novel framework PRoBeNet (Predictive Response Biomarkers using Network medicine) was developed. ProBeNet operates under the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of a drug propagates through a protein\u2013protein interaction network to reverse disease states. ProBeNet prioritizes biomarkers by considering (1) therapy-targeted proteins, (2) disease-specific molecular signatures, and (3) an underlying network of interactions among cellular components (the human interactome). With ProBeNet, biomarkers were discovered predicting patient responses to both an established autoimmune therapy (infliximab) and an investigational compound (a MAPK3/1 inhibitor). Predictive power of ProBeNet biomarkers was validated with retrospective gene-expression data from ulcerative-colitis and rheumatoid-arthritis patients and prospective data from ulcerative-colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patient-derived tissues. Machine-learning models using ProBeNet biomarkers significantly outperformed models using either all genes or randomly selected genes, especially when data were limited (fewer than 20 samples). These results illustrate the value of ProBeNet for reducing features and for constructing robust machine-learning models when limited data are available.

The specific molecular mechanisms linking IH and the development and progression of NAFLD remain elusive. NAFLD pathogenesis is multifactorial including immune cell-driven inflammation as a key mechanism in the transition from fatty liver to steatohepatitis (NASH). The overall goal of this study was to identify the specific impact of IH on liver inflammation in the absence of major confounders frequently encountered in OSA clinical research (i.e., obesity, diabetes, reduced physical activity). We employed a model of lean mice exposed to long-term IH (16 weeks) and a cohort of lean OSA patients free of comorbidities (n=71) coupled with high-throughput hepatic transcriptomics, lipidomics and targeted serum proteomics. For the first time, we have demonstrated that long-term IH is an independent \u201chit\u201d sufficient by itself to induce the NASH molecular signatures found in human steatohepatitis transcriptomic datasets.We identified a unique set of biomarkers in mice and humans (PPARs, NRFs, arachidonic acid, IL16, IL20, IFNB and TNFa) associated with early hepatic and systemic inflammation. This molecular connection between IH, sleep apnea and steatohepatitis warrants further investigation in clinical trials and support the systematic implementation of sleep apnea diagnosis in liver disease phenotyping.

However, it is challenging to inhibit the suppressive function of Tregs for cancer therapy, without impacting immune homeostasis. Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important, yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression, and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues, remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), in non-tumor tonsil tissues and in peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with non-tumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically, the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping and in vitro functional assays, corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs. Finally, we identified a suite of surface molecules reflective of the BATF-driven transcriptional network on intratumoral Tregs in patients with HNSCC.

People at high altitude are susceptible to periodic breathing, and hypoxia at altitude is associated with cardio-metabolic dysfunction. Hypoxemia in these scenarios may be described as superimposed sustained plus intermittent hypoxia, or overlap hypoxia (OH), the effects of which have not been investigated. We aimed to characterize the cardio-metabolic consequences of OH in mice. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to either sustained hypoxia (SH, FiO2=0.10), intermittent hypoxia (IH, FiO2=0.21 for 12 hours, and FiO2 oscillating between 0.21 and 0.06, 60 times/hour, for 12 hours), OH (FiO2=0.13 for 12 hours, and FiO2 oscillating between 0.13 and 0.06, 60 times/hour, for 12 hours), or room air (RA), n=8/group. Blood pressure and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test were measured serially, and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was assessed. Results: Systolic blood pressure transiently increased in IH and OH relative to SH and RA. RVSP did not increase in IH, but increased in SH and OH by 52% (p<0.001) and 20% (p=0.001). Glucose disposal worsened in IH and improved in SH, with no change in OH. Serum LDL and VLDL increased in OH and SH, but not in IH. Hepatic oxidative stress increased in all hypoxic groups, with the highest increase in OH. Conclusions: Overlap hypoxia may represent a unique and deleterious cardio-metabolic stimulus, causing systemic and pulmonary hypertension, and without protective metabolic effects characteristic of sustained hypoxia.", "Title": ["Combined intermittent and sustained hypoxia is a novel and deleterious cardio-metabolic phenotype"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL24247": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Whole liver mRNA profiles of C57BL/6J mice exposed to RA, SH, IH, or OH."], "PubMedIDs": ["34893914"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893914/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5710557", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Room air"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710558", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Room air"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710559", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Room air"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710560", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Room air"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710561", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Sustained hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710562", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Sustained hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710563", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Sustained hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710564", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Sustained hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710565", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Intermittent hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710566", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Intermittent hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710567", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Intermittent hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710568", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Intermittent hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710569", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Overlap hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710570", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Overlap hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710571", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Overlap hypoxia"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM5710572", "TissueType": "Liver", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6J", "tissue: Liver", "age: 12 weeks", "genotype: wild type", "treatment: Overlap hypoxia"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NovaSeq 6000"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE160310", "Summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "Title": ["In-depth transcriptomic analyses investigating molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic retinopathy"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20301": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Refer to individual Series"], "PubMedIDs": ["34006945"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34006945/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM4871112", "TissueType": "Retina Macula", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Retina Macula", "sampleID: sample_01", "samplenumber: 1", "donor: 04_014", "gender: female", "age: 80", "duration_diabetis: n/a", "diabetes_medication: n/a", "other_medication: ASA, levoxyl, verpamil, aldactone, nasonex nasal srapy, vicodin, toprol, mirtazapine, pulmicort puff (glucocorticoid), albuterol inhaler 2 puff, home oxygen, Mg tablets,", "comorbidities: hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), asthma, history of Vfib with MI x 2 s/p AICD placement in 1999.

major global causes for vision loss. With the rise in diabetes prevalence, an increase in DR incidence is expected. Current understanding of both the molecular etiology and pathways involved in the initiation and progression of DR is limited. Here we analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of 80 human post-mortem retinal samples from 80 patients diagnosed with various stages of DR. We found differentially expressed transcripts to be predominantly associated with late stage DR and pathways such as hippo and gap junction signaling. A multivariate regression model identified transcripts with progressive changes throughout disease stages, which in turn displayed significant overlap with sphingolipid and cGMP\u2212PKG signaling. Combined analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression further uncovered disease-relevant miRNA/mRNA associations as potential mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, integrating human retinal single cell RNA-Sequencing data revealed a continuous loss of retinal ganglion cells, and M\u00fcller cell mediated changes in histidine and \u03b2-alanine signaling. Our findings offer an unprecedented insight into the development of DR and provide potential avenues for future therapeutic intervention.", "Title": ["In-depth transcriptomic analyses investigating molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic retinopathy (totalRNA)"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL20301": "Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Post-mortem human eyes from 43 donors were obtained through the Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Coralville, IA) after written informed consent of the next-of-kin was obtained.

characterized by sleep fragmentation and chronic intermittenthypoxia (CIH), is a risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) progression. Recent epidemiologicalstudies point to CIH as the best predictor of developing cognitive decline and AD in elderly withOSA. However, the precise underlying mechanism(s) remain unknown. The present study wasundertaken to evaluate the effect of CIH on pathological human tau seeding, propagation, andaccumulation, cognition, synaptic plasticity, neuronal network excitability, and gene expressionprofiles in a P301S human mutant tau mouse model of AD and related tauopathies. We exposed 4-4.5-month-old, male, P301S and WT mice to an 8-week CIH protocol (6 min cycle:21% O 2 to 8% O 2 to 21% O 2 , 80 cycles per 8 h during daytime), and assessed its effect on taupathology and various AD-related phenotypic and molecular signatures. Age- and gender-matched P301S and WT mice were reared in normoxia (21% O 2 ) as experimental controls. CIH significantly enhanced pathological human tau seeding and spread across connected brain circuitry in P301S mice; it also increased phospho-tau load. CIH also exacerbated memory and synaptic plasticity deficits in P301S mice. However, CIH had no effect on seizure susceptibility and network hyperexcitability in these mice. Finally, CIH exacerbated AD-related pathogenic molecular signaling in P301S mice. CIH-induced increase in pathologic human tau seeding and spread and exacerbation of other AD- related impairments provide new insights into the role of CIH and OSA in AD pathogenesis.", "Title": ["Chronic intermittent hypoxia enhances pathological tau seeding, propagation, and accumulation, and exacerbates Alzheimer\u2019s-like memory and synaptic plasticity deficits and molecular signatures"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL17021": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["RNA-seq of WT Normoxia, WT Hypoxia, P301S Normoxia and P301S Hypoxia mice samples"], "PubMedIDs": [], "PubMedURLs": [], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM5206864", "TissueType": "WT_Normoxia_Brain", "Characteristics": ["strain background: mixed;

chewing, pronunciation, and breathing. Moreover, SMH is prone to inducing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We found that brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1), the core component of the molecular circadian oscillator, was significantly decreased in mandibles of juvenile SMH patients. Accordingly, SMH was observed in circadian rhythm-disrupted or BMAL1-deficiency mice. RNA sequencing and protein chip analyses suggested that matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) is the potential target of BMAL1 during the mandibular developmental process. Interestingly, in juvenile SMH patients, we observed that MMP3 level was increased obviously. Consistently, MMP3 was upregulated during the whole growth period of 3 to 10 weeks in Bmal1-/- mice. Given these findings, we set to characterize the underlying mechanism and found that BMAL1-deficiency enhanced Mmp3 transcription through activating p65 phosphorylation. Together our results provide new insight into the mechanism by which BMAL1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of SMH", "Title": ["BMAL1-deficiency contributes to mandibular dysplasia by upregulating MMP3"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL21273": "HiSeq X Ten (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["To gain an independent assessment of the regulatory targets of BMAL1 in Bmal1-/- mBMSCs"], "PubMedIDs": ["29276151"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29276151/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM2843480", "TissueType": "bone mesenchymal stem cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "passages: 1-3", "cell type: bone mesenchymal stem cells", "genotype: Bmal1-knockout"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2843481", "TissueType": "bone mesenchymal stem cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "passages: 1-3", "cell type: bone mesenchymal stem cells", "genotype: Bmal1-knockout"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2843482", "TissueType": "bone mesenchymal stem cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "passages: 1-3", "cell type: bone mesenchymal stem cells", "genotype: Bmal1-knockout"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2843483", "TissueType": "bone mesenchymal stem cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "passages: 1-3", "cell type: bone mesenchymal stem cells", "genotype: Wild Type"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM2843484", "TissueType": "bone mesenchymal stem cells", "Characteristics": ["strain: C57BL/6", "passages: 1-3", "cell type: bone mesenchymal stem cells", "genotype: Wild Type"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["HiSeq X Ten"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}]}}
